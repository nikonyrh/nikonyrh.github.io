            <p>The NYC taxi&shy;cab dataset has seen lots of love from many data sci&shy;en&shy;tists such as <a
href='http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/' class='external'
target='_blank'>Todd W. Schei&shy;der</a> and <a href='http://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-vertica.html'
class='external' target='_blank'>Mark Litwintschik</a>. I de&shy;cided to give it a go while learn&shy;ing Clo&shy;jure,
as I sus&shy;pected that it might be a good lan&shy;guage for ETL jobs. This ar&shy;ti&shy;cle de&shy;scribes how I
loaded the dataset, nor&shy;mal&shy;ized its con&shy;ven&shy;tions and columns, con&shy;verted from CSV to JSON and
stored them to Elas&shy;tic&shy;search.</p>


            <p>My older desk&shy;top (let's call it "Ma&shy;chine A") has In&shy;tel i5 3570K (quad-core with&shy;out
hy&shy;per-thread&shy;ing), 24 GB RAM and 2 x 250 GB Sam&shy;sung 840 EVOs for data. The newer ("Macine B") has
In&shy;tel i7 6700K (quad-core with hy&shy;per-thread&shy;ing), 64 GB RAM and 2 x 500 GB Sam&shy;sung 750 EVOs for data.
Based on CPU bench&shy;marks it should be about twice as fast as the i5, be&shy;ing roughly equiv&shy;alent 40 AWS ECUs.</p>


            <p>One main goal was to get doc&shy;uments in&shy;dexed to Elas&shy;tic&shy;search as fast as pos&shy;si&shy;ble. Thus I
used two SSDs RAID-0 type con&shy;fig&shy;ura&shy;tion by us&shy;ing  <a
href='https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/FAQ' class='external' target='_blank'>ZFS on Linux</a>. The first
ma&shy;jor ob&shy;sta&shy;cle was that at ini&shy;tially I got great write per&shy;for&shy;mance but af&shy;ter 10
min&shy;utes or so it had dropped to only 40 MB/s! Based on cur&shy;rent and past is&shy;sues at its <a
href='https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues' class='external' target='_blank'>Github repo</a> ZoL doesn't seem
pro&shy;duc&shy;tion ready yet, but I man&shy;aged to find a workaround for my case. When I for&shy;mat&shy;ted SSDs to
EXT4 and cre&shy;ated a 450 GB empty files there, I could suc&shy;cess&shy;fully cre&shy;ate a ZFS pool out of them it
could sus&shy;tain the ex&shy;pected IO per&shy;for&shy;mance. This was a quite puz&shy;zling sit&shy;ua&shy;tion, but I
ended up cre&shy;at&shy;ing a 8 GB file to EXT4-for&shy;mat&shy;ted Sam&shy;sung 850 EVO m2 card (which is the main
sys&shy;tem disk) and us&shy;ing it as ZIL for my pool. For some rea&shy;son this kept the IO per&shy;for&shy;mance at
nor&shy;mal lev&shy;els and I did not have to run ZFS on top of EXT4.</p>


            <p>CSV files are stored in a Gzipped for&shy;mat, from which they are lazily read as Clo&shy;jure strings by <span
class=sourcecode>java.util.zip.GZIP&shy;In&shy;put&shy;Stream</span>. Ini&shy;tial im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion
would <span class=sourcecode>slurp</span> the whole CSV string and pass it to <span class=sourcecode>read-csv</span>,
but this at too much RAM when mul&shy;ti&shy;ple large files are be&shy;ing pro&shy;cessed in par&shy;al&shy;lel. The
pro&shy;cess of con&shy;vert&shy;ing CSV rows in to Elas&shy;tic&shy;search doc&shy;uments is quite
straight-for&shy;ward. The code has a lookup dic&shy;tio&shy;nary to map CSV columns into JSON fields of speci&shy;fic
types. In to&shy;tal there are 36 fields. Yel&shy;low and Green taxi&shy;cab datasets had some dif&shy;fer&shy;ences on
column nam&shy;ing but at least their mean&shy;ing was easy to rec&shy;og&shy;nize. The code also gen&shy;er&shy;ates
some new fields to each doc, such as the time of day when the trip started (0 - 24 h), how many kilo&shy;me&shy;ters
were trav&shy;elled lat&shy;itude / lon&shy;gi&shy;tude wise and what was the av&shy;er&shy;age speed dur&shy;ing the
trip. It also stores that day's weather at Cen&shy;tral Park to each doc&shy;ument, as Elas&shy;tic&shy;search does not
have ad-hoc joins un&shy;like SQL databases.</p>


            <p>Orig&shy;inally I gen&shy;er&shy;ated doc&shy;ument ids in Clo&shy;jure and used those to skip chunks which had
al&shy;ready been in&shy;serted to ES, which was handy when I was it&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ing the code and sort&shy;ing out
mal&shy;formed data. Later I dis&shy;carded this as it slows down in&shy;dex&shy;ing pro&shy;cess quite a lot.
Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less doc id gen&shy;er&shy;ation code was still used it to fil&shy;ter out du&shy;pli&shy;cates
be&shy;fore sendin them to ES. But there are less than hun&shy;dred of them so now I don't even bother
re&shy;mov&shy;ing them. It was caus&shy;ing quite a lot of mem&shy;ory and garbage col&shy;lec&shy;tion over&shy;head
for very lit&shy;tle gain, but I'm sure du&shy;pli&shy;cate re&shy;moval util&shy;ity will be use&shy;ful on other
pro&shy;jects.</p>


            <p>There are many fac&shy;tors which af&shy;fect in&shy;dex&shy;ing per&shy;for&shy;mance, and I didn't care&shy;fully
mea&shy;sure all of their im&shy;pacts as it is quite te&shy;dious to ex&shy;ecute and your mileage will vary
any&shy;way. Note that many ar&shy;ti&shy;cles on the topic Elas&shy;tic&shy;search op&shy;ti&shy;miza&shy;tions are for
ver&shy;sions of 1.x and 2.x but aren't rel&shy;evant on lat&shy;est ES 5.x ver&shy;sions. CSV pars&shy;ing is
sin&shy;gle-threaded, so to uti&shy;lize mul&shy;ti&shy;ple CPU cores many files are parsed in par&shy;al&shy;lel. At
first I used my own code for this, based on Clo&shy;jure's <a href='https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/pmap'
class='external' target='_blank'>pmap</a> but with con&shy;fig&shy;urable num&shy;ber of threads. How&shy;ever seemed to
work poorly when some files took much longer to pro&shy;cess than oth&shy;ers, and par&shy;al&shy;lelism
di&shy;min&shy;ished un&shy;til the larger file was fin&shy;ished and then new fu&shy;tures were deref&shy;er&shy;enced.
This was re&shy;solved by us&shy;ing <a href='https://github.com/TheClimateCorporation/claypoole' class='external'
target='_blank'>Clay&shy;poole's</a> mag&shy;nif&shy;icent <span class=sourcecode>up&shy;for</span>, which will
ex&shy;ecute the jobs in N par&shy;al&shy;lel threads and re&shy;turn the fastest re&shy;sults first. Doc&shy;uments
were bulk-up&shy;loaded in chunks of  1000.</p>


            <p>I had one in&shy;dex / year / com&shy;pany, and each in&shy;dex had only ten shards. I started with only one shard /
in&shy;dex but it caused merge throt&shy;tling in the long run as in&shy;dexes grow to tens of gi&shy;ga&shy;bytes. For
ex&shy;am&shy;ple the in&shy;dex <span class=sourcecode>taxi&shy;cab-yel&shy;low-2014</span> has 164.2 mil&shy;lion docs
and takes 48.5 GB of stor&shy;age.</p>


            <p>In&shy;dex&shy;ing from A to B was con&shy;strained by A's CPU power to trans&shy;form CSV rows to JSON,
in&shy;dex&shy;ing them to Elas&shy;tic&shy;search over a gi&shy;ga&shy;bit LAN at 100 - 150 Mbit/s. Ma&shy;chine B's
CPU us&shy;age was fluc&shy;tu&shy;at&shy;ing be&shy;tween 30 and 50 per&shy;cent. In 10 min&shy;utes it could
in&shy;dex 9.55 mil&shy;lion doc&shy;uments, thus av&shy;er&shy;ag&shy;ing at 15931 docs / sec&shy;ond. When us&shy;ing
only ma&shy;chine B to han&shy;dle both work&shy;loads it would be sat&shy;urated by CPU, to&shy;tal&shy;ing at 11.9
mil&shy;lion docs in 10 min&shy;utes, or 19869 docs / sec&shy;ond. When in&shy;dex&shy;ing from ma&shy;chine B to
ma&shy;chine A it wasn't clear where the bot&shy;tle&shy;neck was as both CPUs were used at 50 per&shy;cent. It could be
caused by buggy firmware on my 840 EVOs as I haven't up&shy;dated them yet. Any&shy;way, this se&shy;tup man&shy;aged to
store only 4.6 mil&shy;lion docs in 10 min&shy;utes, or av&shy;er&shy;ag&shy;ing at 7746 docs / sec&shy;ond. Top
per&shy;for&shy;mance was ob&shy;tained by pars&shy;ing CSVs on both ma&shy;chi&shy;nes and host&shy;ing ES on
ma&shy;chine B, to&shy;tal&shy;ing at 14.3 mil&shy;lion docs, or at av&shy;er&shy;age of 23909 docs / sec&shy;ond. Even
at this speed in&shy;dex&shy;ing 1 bil&shy;lion doc&shy;uments would take about 11.6 hours.</p>


            <p>In the end I used just ma&shy;chine B to in&shy;dex all doc&shy;uments in a sin&shy;gle go, which took 910 min&shy;utes
and stored 942.1 mil&shy;lion doc&shy;uments. Then I "force merged" in&shy;dexes to have at most 8 seg&shy;ments each,
this took 44 min&shy;utes. Fi&shy;nally merg&shy;ing them down to 1 seg&shy;ment took 302 min&shy;utes, al&shy;though
CPU and disk IO us&shy;age was very low. It seems to have build-in throt&shy;tling as well, but I couldn't find
de&shy;tailed doc&shy;umen&shy;ta&shy;tion. The fi&shy;nal size on disk was 309 GB.</p>


            <p>Once the data is stored to ES there are end&shy;less pos&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ities for in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing
anal&shy;ysis. Kibana makes it easy to get started with un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing the dataset and ex&shy;ecut&shy;ing
ad-hoc queries, but of course if you want full con&shy;trol over de&shy;tails and op&shy;ti&shy;miza&shy;tions then
you'll have to im&shy;ple&shy;ment lots of stuff your&shy;self. Here I'll just show pat&shy;terns from a sin&shy;gle
fact: the date-time when the trip started. This is split into three parts: date, day of week and time of day. One can
ex&shy;pect week&shy;ends hav&shy;ing dif&shy;fer&shy;ent taxi de&shy;mand than rest of the days.</p>

chart</a>, which is seen on Fig&shy;ure 4. It lets you choose how doc&shy;uments are "buck&shy;etet" along the x and y
axis and what is the vi&shy;su&shy;al&shy;ized met&shy;ric. This makes weekly cy&shy;cles quite vis&shy;ible
es&shy;pe&shy;cially in 2 - 5 am range but I find it more dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to ex&shy;trap&shy;olate the data
for&shy;ward when com&shy;pared to line charts.  It doesn't han&shy;dle out&shy;liers nicely, at least if the
his&shy;togram ag&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion is used. Luck&shy;ily they are easy to fil&shy;ter out in the query phase, if
the ex&shy;pected data range is known.</p>
