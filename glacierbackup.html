            <p>In ad&shy;di&shy;tion to a mir&shy;rored and check-summed <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS' class='external'
target='_blank'>ZFS</a> based backup server, I wanted to have back&shy;ups out&shy;side by premises to be safer against
haz&shy;ards such as bur&shy;glary, fire and wa&shy;ter dam&shy;age. ZFS can al&shy;ready re&shy;sist sin&shy;gle disk
fail&shy;ure and can re&shy;pair silent data cor&shy;rup&shy;tion, but for im&shy;por&shy;tant mem&shy;ories that isn't
suf&shy;fi&shy;cient level of pro&shy;tec&shy;tion. My ever-grow&shy;ing data set is cur&shy;rently 150k files,
hav&shy;ing a to&shy;tal size of 520 Gb. Ama&shy;zon's <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/' class='external'
target='_blank'>Glacier</a> seems to be the most cost ef&shy;fi&shy;cient so&shy;lu&shy;tion with
so&shy;phis&shy;ti&shy;cated APIs and SDKs.</p>


            <p>Cur&shy;rently the Glacier stor&shy;age at EU Ire&shy;land is priced at 0.011 USD / Gb / month, which is about 0.10 EUR
/ Gb / year, or only 50 EUR / year for 500 Gb of data. How&shy;ever data re&shy;trieval cost cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tions
are quite non-triv&shy;ial, be&shy;cause of nu&shy;mer&shy;ous quo&shy;tas and the pric&shy;ing is based on monthly peak
re&shy;trieval rate. The best ref&shy;er&shy;ence for this is an <a href='http://liangzan.net/aws-glacier-calculator/'
class='external' target='_blank'>Un&shy;of&shy;fi&shy;cial Ama&shy;zon AWS Glacier Cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tor</a>, which
tells us that to down&shy;load 500 Gb in two weeks costs 11.51 USD for re&shy;trieval from Glacier stor&shy;age and
59.88 USD for trans&shy;fer cost, to&shy;talling at roughly 60 USD or 44 EUR. Halv&shy;ing the re&shy;trieval time
dou&shy;bles the re&shy;trieval cost, so it is im&shy;por&shy;tant to split the data in smaller files and re&shy;trieve
them in a care&shy;fully sched&shy;uled man&shy;ner. This doesn't bother me too much be&shy;cause I hope I don't ever
need to re&shy;sort to this, and in&shy;stead it is al&shy;most like write-only mem&shy;ory.</p>


            <p>Pric&shy;ing in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion can be ex&shy;pected to change quite rapidly, but I'm go&shy;ing to quote
cur&shy;rent prices for ref&shy;er&shy;ence any&shy;way. Per&shy;haps the most pop&shy;ular ser&shy;vice <a
href='https://www.dropbox.com/upgrade' class='external' target='_blank'>Drop&shy;box</a> quotes 500 EUR / year for 500
Gb, as can be seen from Fig&shy;ure 1. Un&shy;lim&shy;ited <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/business/pricing'
class='external' target='_blank'>Drop&shy;box for Busi&shy;ness</a> is 15 USD / month / user, but a min&shy;imum of 5
users is re&shy;quired. Any&shy;way Drop&shy;box is meant for read-write data stor&shy;age and shar&shy;ing, not for
"of&shy;fline-like" backup-only so&shy;lu&shy;tion. I'm un&shy;sure if it sup&shy;ports user-con&shy;fig&shy;ured
en&shy;cryp&shy;tion keys, un&shy;less the user has to keep en&shy;crypted and de&shy;crypted copies of data on his/her
com&shy;puter.</p>

            <p>An other in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing ser&shy;vice is <a href='http://www.backblaze.com/best-online-backup-service.html'
class='external' target='_blank'>Black&shy;blaze</a>, which of&shy;fers un&shy;lim&shy;ited stor&shy;age for 50 USD /
year, which is very com&shy;pet&shy;itive. Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nately they don't sup&shy;port Linux or Unix, which I
want to use for main stor&shy;age to get the ben&shy;efits of ZFS. Also their clients are based on
con&shy;sumer-friendly syn&shy;chro&shy;niza&shy;tion prin&shy;ci&shy;ple, so there is less fine-tuned con&shy;trol on
what is ac&shy;tu&shy;ally hap&shy;pen&shy;ing. They also com&shy;pare them&shy;selves to their com&shy;peti&shy;tors,
and quoted prices can be seen in Fig&shy;ure 2.</p>

            <p>Given all these more or less ready-made so&shy;lu&shy;tions, I still ended up in choos&shy;ing the Ama&shy;zon Glacier
ser&shy;vice. I was lured in by the <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/free/' class='external' target='_blank'>AWS Free
Tier</a> of&shy;fer and the fa&shy;mil&shy;iar by-en&shy;gi&shy;neers-for-en&shy;gi&shy;neers ap&shy;proach. It also
gives me good first-hand ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence on <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/' class='external'
target='_blank'>Sim&shy;ple Stor&shy;age Ser&shy;vice</a> (S3), which's <a
href='http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html' class='external' target='_blank'>life
cy&shy;cle man&shy;age&shy;ment</a> I use to move files to their fi&shy;nal des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion: Ama&shy;zon
Glacier.</p>


            <p>I nat&shy;urally or&shy;ga&shy;nize my files based on their topic and date, but on my pre-ex&shy;ist&shy;ing files I had
to also split the files into smaller sub&shy;sets. The ini&shy;tial step was to or&shy;ga&shy;nize the data into about
50 - 100 GB fold&shy;ers, each of which is fur&shy;ther split into about 10 GB par&shy;ti&shy;tions. Each file in these
sub&shy;sets is then <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1' class='external' target='_blank'>SHA-1</a>
check-summed and this file is stored into Drop&shy;box and other ser&shy;vices. Based on this file I can search files
based on their (full) file name and their ac&shy;tual con&shy;tents.</p>

            <div style='padding-top: 32px; padding-bottom: 32px; text-align: center'>
                <a href='GlacierBackup_data_chunk.png' class='lightbox'>

                <div style='padding-top: 16px; max-width: 95%; text-align: justify; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'>
                    <b>Figure 3</b>: Files are di&shy;vided into about 10 GB sub&shy;sets, zipped and then split&shy;ted into 500 MB chunks. These chunks are then up&shy;loaded to S3/Glacier and check&shy;summed.
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Af&shy;ter cre&shy;at&shy;ing in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;ual par&shy;ti&shy;tions, the ac&shy;tual com&shy;pres&shy;sion and
en&shy;cryp&shy;tion can be done. The bash script is based on pip&shy;ing zip and <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL' class='external' target='_blank'>OpenSSL</a> Linux util&shy;ities, and the
used en&shy;cryp&shy;tion method is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard' class='external'
target='_blank'>AES-256</a> in <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29' class='external'
target='_blank'>CBC</a> mode with ran&shy;dom salt. It is cru&shy;cial not to for&shy;get the pass&shy;word for these
back&shy;ups, be&shy;cause there is no other re&shy;cov&shy;ery method than brute-force.</p>


            <p>Since the data in ques&shy;tion is mostly RAW cam&shy;era files they aren't that com&shy;press&shy;ible, the
re&shy;sult&shy;ing zip files are roughly 10 GB each as well. Be&shy;fore up&shy;load&shy;ing these are split into 500
MB chunks, which il&shy;lus&shy;trated in Fig&shy;ure 3. This en&shy;ables eas&shy;ier up&shy;load re&shy;tries and
fine-tuned Glacier re&shy;trieval rate. The re&shy;sult&shy;ing zip files and their 500 Mb or less chunks are also SHA-1
check&shy;summed. Ama&shy;zon re&shy;ports so-called <a
href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6591047/etag-definition-changed-in-amazon-s3' class='external'
target='_blank'>ETag</a> hashes, which is based on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5' class='external'
target='_blank'>MD5</a> hashes of up&shy;loaded parts. It can more-or-less prove that Ama&shy;zon got the in&shy;tact
copy of the file over the in&shy;ter&shy;net.</p>


            <p>My scripts uti&shy;lize stan&shy;dard <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/cli/' class='external' target='_blank'>AWS CLI</a>
and <a href='https://github.com/Teachnova/s3md5' class='external' target='_blank'>s3md5</a> com&shy;mand line
util&shy;ities, so no Perl or PHP cod&shy;ing is re&shy;quired (ex&shy;cept the Python abort script to clean-up aborted
multi-part up&shy;loads, which is based on <a href='http://rayofsolaris.net/blog/2012/s3-multipart-cleanup'
class='external' target='_blank'>this blog post</a> and <a href='https://github.com/boto/boto' class='external'
target='_blank'>boto</a>. The zip, en&shy;crypt, split and check&shy;sum com&shy;mands look like this:</p>

            <span class=sourcecode>zip - -q -r path/to/sub&shy;set | openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -k pass&shy;word &gt;
sub&shy;set.zip.aes</span> <br/>
<span class=sourcecode>split -d --bytes=500M sub&shy;set.zip.aes sub&shy;set.zip.aes_p</span> <br/>
<span class=sourcecode>sha1sum sub&shy;set.zip.aes* | tee sub&shy;set.sha1.txt</span> <br/>
<span class=sourcecode>ls sub&shy;set.zip.aes_p* | xargs -n1 ./s3md5.sh 7 | tee sub&shy;set.etag.txt</span>

            <p>Bea&shy;cuse I have 2 x 250 Gb SSD drives in RAID-0 con&shy;fig&shy;ura&shy;tion (via ZFS), even the Core i5
pro&shy;ces&shy;sor is able to cal&shy;cu&shy;late check&shy;sums in par&shy;al&shy;lel at 1 GB/s (8 Gb/s)! Thus
mul&shy;ti&shy;ple passes over the data will be fast.</p>


            <p>The cur&shy;rent ver&shy;sion of s3md5.sh can only parse in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;ual files, so <span
class=sourcecode>xargs</span> is used to gen&shy;er&shy;ate this se&shy;quence of pro&shy;gram ex&shy;ecu&shy;tions. The
pa&shy;ram&shy;eter "7" tells s3md5.sh that files are up&shy;loaded in 7 MB chunks. It also gave wrong re&shy;sults if
the file hap&shy;pened to be evenly split into x MB chunks, in which case the last chunk is an empty zero-length string
which needs to be ig&shy;nored. I'll be send&shy;ing a pull re&shy;quest on these patches later. This com&shy;mand can
be used to con&shy;firm that the files will de&shy;crypt cor&shy;rectly:</p>

            <span class=sourcecode>cat sub&shy;set.zip.aes_p* &gt; sub&shy;set.zip.aes.tmp</span> <br/>
<span class=sourcecode>openssl aes-256-cbc -d -salt -in sub&shy;set.zip.aes.tmp -k pass&shy;word &gt; /dev/null</span>

            <p>Nat&shy;urally I have writ&shy;ten nicer scripts to wrap these com&shy;mands, to en&shy;able easy it&shy;er&shy;ation
over files etc. The ac&shy;tual up&shy;load uses the <span class=sourcecode>aws s3 cp --stor&shy;age-class
RE&shy;DUCED_RE&shy;DUN&shy;DANCY</span> com&shy;mand, which is wrapped in <a
href='http://www.tuxradar.com/content/control-your-bandwidth-trickle' class='external' target='_blank'>trickle</a>
com&shy;mand to limit the up&shy;load band&shy;width. The S3 bucket is con&shy;fig&shy;ured to move files to Glacier
stor&shy;age af&shy;ter 1 day, so typ&shy;ically lower stor&shy;age re&shy;dun&shy;dancy is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient. This
pro&shy;vides 99.99% dura&shy;bil&shy;ity, where Glacier guar&shy;an&shy;tees 99.999999999%. If the file goes
miss&shy;ing within the one day pe&shy;riod it can eas&shy;ily be re-up&shy;loaded (as&shy;sum&shy;ing this doesn't go
un&shy;no&shy;ticed). Over&shy;all the AWS Glacier seems like a good so&shy;lu&shy;tion, if you wan to have full
con&shy;trol on all as&shy;pects of you stor&shy;age "medium". How&shy;ever it takes ex&shy;tra care to prop&shy;erly
or&shy;ga&shy;nize your data and to be sure to use cor&shy;rect en&shy;cryp&shy;tion keys, and hope that there is no
in-RAM cor&shy;rup&shy;tion if you aren't us&shy;ing ECC RAM (I'm not).</p>


            <p>This pro&shy;ject was ini&shy;tially set-up to archive my old files re&shy;li&shy;ably and cheaply to the cloud, and it
suc&shy;ceeds well in this task. Af&shy;ter fin&shy;ish&shy;ing the up&shy;load&shy;ing pro&shy;cess of 520 GB of data,
I need to ex&shy;tend these scripts to han&shy;dle au&shy;to&shy;matic in&shy;cre&shy;men&shy;tal back&shy;ups of
still-chang&shy;ing fresh files. A sim&shy;ple so&shy;lu&shy;tion would be to use a  <a
href='http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/' class='external' target='_blank'>Elas&shy;tic Block Stor&shy;age</a> vol&shy;ume at <a
href='http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?nc1=h_l2_cn' class='external' target='_blank'>Elas&shy;tic Com&shy;pute Cloud</a>, and
to use <a href='http://www.bittorrent.com/sync' class='external' target='_blank'>Bit&shy;Tor&shy;rent Sync</a> P2P
soft&shy;ware to up&shy;load en&shy;crypted in&shy;cre&shy;men&shy;tal ZIP files. This is a bit less of a con&shy;cern
be&shy;cause typ&shy;ically I still have a copy of the files on my lap&shy;top as well.</p>
