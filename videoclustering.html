            <p>This ar&shy;ti&shy;cle de&shy;scribes a neu&shy;ral net&shy;work which au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;ically pro&shy;jects a
large col&shy;lec&shy;tion of video frames (or im&shy;ages) into 2D co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nates, based on their
con&shy;tent and sim&shy;ilar&shy;ity. It can be used to find con&shy;tent such as ex&shy;plo&shy;sions from Arnold's
movies, or car sce&shy;nes from Bonds. It was orig&shy;inally de&shy;vel&shy;oped to or&shy;ga&shy;nize over 6 hours of
Go&shy;Pro footage from Åre bike trip from the sum&shy;mer of 2020, and cre&shy;ate a high-res poster which shows the
beau&shy;ti&shy;ful and vary&shy;ing land&shy;scape (Fig&shy;ure 9).</p>


            <p>The model's data pipeline and ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;ture are fairly sim&shy;ple, and its overview shown in Fig&shy;ure
1. The high-res, high-band&shy;with video is first down&shy;sam&shy;pled by FFM&shy;PEG , keep&shy;ing only 0.2% of the
raw data. This is done by scal&shy;ing down the video res&shy;olu&shy;tion by 80% and drop&shy;ping 95% of the frames.
"Raw" video frames are kept in a <a href='https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.memmap.html'
class='external' target='_blank'>mem&shy;ory-mapped NumPy ar&shy;ray</a>, for fast ran&shy;dom ac&shy;cess dur&shy;ing
vi&shy;su&shy;al&shy;iza&shy;tions. Al&shy;though 99.8% of the data is al&shy;ready dis&shy;carded, 6.2 hours of
con&shy;tent still con&shy;sists of 67k frames which take 32 GB of disk space in a RGB uint8 for&shy;mat.</p>

The 2D rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion (au&shy;toen&shy;coder's "code" or "em&shy;bed&shy;ding") is used to or&shy;ga&shy;nize the im&shy;ages on a brows&shy;able UI, or as de&shy;scrip&shy;tors for video clus&shy;ter&shy;ing &amp; sim&shy;ilar&shy;ity search.

            <p>A pre-trained <a href='https://keras.io/api/applications/xception/' class='external' target='_blank'>Xcep&shy;tion</a>
net&shy;work is used to ex&shy;tract de&shy;scrip&shy;tive fea&shy;tures from each frame. It takes in a 299 &times; 299
&times; 3 RGB im&shy;age, and out&shy;puts its pre&shy;dic&shy;tions of what kind of im&shy;age it is. It has been
trained to iden&shy;tify 1000 dif&shy;fer&shy;ent cat&shy;egories, such as "lion", "ski", "desk" and "bar&shy;ber
chair". Classes are ex&shy;clu&shy;sive, so pre&shy;dicted class prob&shy;abil&shy;itites add up to 100%. In this case
the fi&shy;nal pre&shy;dic&shy;tion layer is dropped, so the model out&shy;puts a 2048 di&shy;men&shy;sional
"de&shy;scrip&shy;tor" of the im&shy;age. This is fairly ro&shy;bust to changes in the in&shy;put im&shy;age, since its
goal is to iden&shy;tify these ob&shy;ject cat&shy;egories from very dif&shy;fer&shy;ent look&shy;ing im&shy;ages. Its
ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;ture is shown on Fig&shy;ure 2, and more de&shy;tails can be found from the <a
href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357' class='external' target='_blank'>pub&shy;li&shy;ca&shy;tion</a>.</p>


            <p>The source video has an as&shy;pect ra&shy;tio of 16:9 but the Xcep&shy;tion net&shy;work's in&shy;put is
rect&shy;an&shy;gu&shy;lar. One could just squeeze the in&shy;put im&shy;age into a rect&shy;an&shy;gu&shy;lar shape,
but here a dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ap&shy;proach was used. The in&shy;put 534 &times; 300 im&shy;age is cropped to left and
right halves of size 300 &times; 300 and they are scaled to 299 &times; 299. Pix&shy;els near the im&shy;age cen&shy;ter
are pre&shy;sent in both in&shy;puts, but that doesn't mat&shy;ter. This re&shy;duces the amount of data per im&shy;age
by 99.1%, com&shy;press&shy;ing it down to a rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive vec&shy;tor of 4096
di&shy;men&shy;sions.</p>

            <p>The next step is to com&shy;press the rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion down even fur&shy;ther, to just two
di&shy;men&shy;sions. This is de&shy;sir&shy;able since a 2D space is very easy to vi&shy;su&shy;al&shy;ize, and the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder' class='external' target='_blank'>au&shy;toen&shy;coder</a>'s
re&shy;pro&shy;duc&shy;tion-ac&shy;cu&shy;racy is not rel&shy;evant in this ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion. The model can be
done more lightweight by pre&shy;pro&shy;cess&shy;ing the data even fur&shy;ther be&shy;fore pass&shy;ing it to the
au&shy;toen&shy;coder. One easy so&shy;lu&shy;tion is to use <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis' class='external' target='_blank'>Prin&shy;ci&shy;pal
Com&shy;po&shy;nent Anal&shy;ysis</a>. It finds lin&shy;ear cor&shy;re&shy;la&shy;tions be&shy;tween fea&shy;tures, and
de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;nes a lin&shy;ear pro&shy;jec&shy;tion which pre&shy;serves as much of the vari&shy;ance as
pos&shy;si&shy;ble. It was used to com&shy;press the fea&shy;tures from 4096 to 256 di&shy;men&shy;sions (-93.75%) but
drop&shy;ping only about 25% of the "in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion" (vari&shy;ance).</p>


            <p>The fi&shy;nal step is to re&shy;ducie the num&shy;ber of di&shy;men&shy;sions from 256 to 2 and back to 256, while
match&shy;ing the orig&shy;inal in&shy;put as well as pos&shy;si&shy;ble in the out&shy;put. An other so&shy;lu&shy;tion
would have been to use <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding'
class='external' target='_blank'>t-SNE</a> here, but an au&shy;toen&shy;coder gives more con&shy;trol to the re&shy;sult
since one can use var&shy;ious reg&shy;ular&shy;iza&shy;tion meth&shy;ods.</p>


            <p>The au&shy;toen&shy;coder uses only <span class=sourcecode>Dense</span> and <span
class=sourcecode>Batch&shy;Nor&shy;mal&shy;iza&shy;tion</span> lay&shy;ers, but there are quite a few
hy&shy;per&shy;pa&shy;ram&shy;eters to choose. At the en&shy;cod&shy;ing stage, all <span class=sourcecode>Dense</span>
lay&shy;ers use the <span class=sourcecode>elu</span> ac&shy;ti&shy;va&shy;tion func&shy;tion, ex&shy;cept the last one
uses <span class=sourcecode>tanh</span> which con&shy;strains the out&shy;put to a range of -1 to 1. <span
class=sourcecode>Elu</span> is used be&shy;cause it is found to work well on re&shy;gres&shy;sion prob&shy;lems. There
are two <span class=sourcecode>Dense</span> lay&shy;ers be&shy;tween the in&shy;put and out&shy;put lay&shy;ers, and
their sizes are de&shy;ter&shy;mined by weighted ge&shy;omet&shy;ric means: ap&shy;prox&shy;imately (256<sup>2</sup> *
2<sup>1</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup> and (256<sup>1</sup> * 2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup>.</p>

            <p>The de&shy;coder is very sim&shy;ilar, ex&shy;cept the di&shy;men&shy;sion gets pro&shy;gres&shy;sively larger. All
<span class=sourcecode>Dense</span> lay&shy;ers use the <span class=sourcecode>elu</span> ac&shy;ti&shy;va&shy;tion
func&shy;tion again, ex&shy;cept the last one uses just the <span class=sourcecode>lin&shy;ear</span> one. It uses more
pa&shy;ram&shy;eters, to ease up the re&shy;con&shy;struc&shy;tion. The en&shy;coder shouldn't be too com&shy;plex,
be&shy;cause it may lead fairly sim&shy;ilar in&shy;puts to be far apart in the 2D plane.
In&shy;ter&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate layer sizes are again cal&shy;cu&shy;lated via a weighted ge&shy;omet&shy;ric mean.</p>

            <p>Ad&shy;di&shy;tional reg&shy;ular&shy;iza&shy;tions are ap&shy;plied to guilde the re&shy;sult&shy;ing 2D
em&shy;bed&shy;ding (aka. "cod&shy;ing" or "code"). It is de&shy;sir&shy;able that the point cloud's mean is zero and
the stan&shy;dard de&shy;vi&shy;ation is "suf&shy;fi&shy;ciently" large. Here an std of 0.3 was used, which is
suf&shy;fi&shy;ciently small that a Gaus&shy;sian dis&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tion with this std has only 0.1% of
sam&shy;ples be&shy;ing out&shy;side the range of the <span class=sourcecode>tanh</span> ac&shy;ti&shy;va&shy;tion
func&shy;tion. This reg&shy;ular&shy;iza&shy;tion is eas&shy;ily done in Keras with a <a
href='https://keras.io/api/layers/regularizers/' class='external' target='_blank'>ac&shy;tiv&shy;ity
reg&shy;ular&shy;izer</a>.</p>


            <p>The sec&shy;ond "reg&shy;ular&shy;iza&shy;tion" tech&shy;nique is sim&shy;ilar to a <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_loss' class='external' target='_blank'>triplet loss</a> or <a
href='https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/01/18/contrastive-loss-for-siamese-networks-with-keras-and-tensorflow/'
class='external' target='_blank'>con&shy;trastive loss</a>. The main loss func&shy;tion is still the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error' class='external' target='_blank'>MSE</a> of the
au&shy;toen&shy;coder's re&shy;con&shy;struc&shy;tion, but the model has a sec&shy;ond out&shy;put as well. The
net&shy;work ac&shy;tu&shy;ally takes three in&shy;puts (<span class=sourcecode>A</span>, <span
class=sourcecode>B</span> and <span class=sourcecode>C</span>), only the first one of which is used to train the
autoencoder. The three images are consecutive frames from a video, so it expected that they share some similarity with
each other. So the model is guided to also minimize (<span class=sourcecode>encode</span>(A) + <span
class=sourcecode>encode</span>(C)) / 2 - <span class=sourcecode>encode</span>(B), meaning that <span
class=sourcecode>B</span>'s 2D embedding should be located between the embedding of <span class=sourcecode>A</span> and
<span class=sourcecode>C</span>.</p>


            <p>How&shy;ever this didn't end up work&shy;ing too well, es&shy;pe&shy;cially with movies where the scene con&shy;sists of
clips from sev&shy;eral cam&shy;era an&shy;gles. A bet&shy;ter so&shy;lu&shy;tion was to cal&shy;cu&shy;late
log((&epsilon; + sum((A - B)<sup>2</sup>))/(&epsilon; + sum((B - C)<sup>2</sup>))) on a random triplets of <span
class=sourcecode>A</span>, <span class=sourcecode>B</span> &amp; <span class=sourcecode>C</span>. The encoder is guided
to structure the coding so that the log-ratio applies also to values of <span class=sourcecode>encode(A)</span>, <span
class=sourcecode>encode(B)</span> &amp; <span class=sourcecode>encode(C)</span>. This worked well for biking videos and
also for movies.</p>


            <p>Ex&shy;am&shy;ple em&shy;bed&shy;dings are shown in Fig&shy;ure 3. The left one has a stan&shy;dard de&shy;vi&shy;ation
of 0.3, and the right one has 0.6. The lat&shy;ter op&shy;tion didn't re&shy;sult in the de&shy;sired uni&shy;form
dis&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tion, rather it pushed lots of points to the margin of the <span class=sourcecode>tanh</span>

            <p>Each point on the scat&shy;ter plot cor&shy;re&shy;sponds to a speci&shy;fic frame from a speci&shy;fic video. This
means that we can trace a speci&shy;fic video's "path" within the 2D space, and use it as a fin&shy;ger&shy;print.
Fig&shy;ure 4 shows nine such paths, which have been cho&shy;sen to be as dis&shy;sim&shy;ilar from each as
pos&shy;si&shy;ble. Their cor&shy;re&shy;spond&shy;ing video frame se&shy;quences are shown on the right sade, each

they have very dif&shy;fer&shy;ent scenery. Be&shy;cause of this, there is rel&shy;atively lit&shy;tle over&shy;lap
be&shy;tween dif&shy;fer&shy;ent videos' paths. It is pos&shy;si&shy;ble to check the small leg&shy;end on the

mostly at the y < 0 region, and they seem to represent a very harsh and rocky terrain. They are filmed at the higher
region of the Åre mountain, some frames even show some snow although it was in the middle of the summer. The small blue

the re&shy;sult was a bit un&shy;ex&shy;pected, and the 2D em&shy;bed&shy;ding is quite sparse in the mid&shy;dle. It

            <p>If we want to vi&shy;su&shy;al&shy;ize the whole em&shy;bed&shy;ding space as im&shy;ages, it is de&shy;sire&shy;able
that the whole space is cov&shy;ered with im&shy;ages. The left side of Fig&shy;ure 3 has green lines plot&shy;ted on
it, show&shy;ing the es&shy;ti&shy;mated "per&shy;centile dis&shy;tance" from the origin. These es&shy;ti&shy;mates can
then be used to stretch the dis&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tion, so that it would cover the whole plane more equally. The end
re&shy;sult is showin in the mid&shy;dle of Fig&shy;ure \3. The re&shy;sult isn't ideal, but bet&shy;ter than the
start&shy;ing dis&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tion and bet&shy;ter than the dis&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tion on the right (an

            <p>Im&shy;ages are tiled on a grid based on their po&shy;si&shy;tion in the 2D space, and this is shown on the left side of

me&shy;ter wide print. To get a higher DPI we can in&shy;crease the cached im&shy;ages' res&shy;olu&shy;tion, tile more
im&shy;ages or seek orig&shy;inal frames from high-res MP4 video files. Ran&shy;dom seek on video is fairly slow, but it
doesn't mat&shy;ter on a one-time ef&shy;fort. And be&shy;fore gen&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ing it we can still use the low-res
in-mem&shy;ory cached ones for fast im&shy;age pre&shy;views.</p>


            <p>If we don't like the com&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion, we can al&shy;ways re-train the au&shy;toen&shy;coder and let it
con&shy;verge to a dif&shy;fer&shy;ent rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion. Al&shy;though it is ex&shy;pected that it
al&shy;ways or&shy;ga&shy;nizes the im&shy;ages in a more or less sta&shy;ble man&shy;ner. An other op&shy;tion is to
di&shy;rectly ma&shy;nip&shy;ulate the em&shy;bed&shy;dings, as we al&shy;ready did when we scaled them away from the
origin. Also an ar&shy;bi&shy;trary ro&shy;ta&shy;tion can be ap&shy;plied be&shy;fore scal&shy;ing.</p>


            <p>The fi&shy;nal ex&shy;am&shy;ples at fig&shy;ures 10 - 12 show im&shy;age clus&shy;ters from the movie cat&shy;egories:

target='_blank'>James Bond</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuno_Turhapuro#Uuno_Turhapuro_films'
class='external' target='_blank'>Uuno Turha&shy;puro</a>. Everybody knows Arnold and Bond, but Uuno isn't well known
outside Finland. He is a Finnish comedy character, created in the early 1970s. Each dataset was run separatedldly
through the dataflow shown in Figure 1, and the encoded embeddings were re-scaled to fill the 2D plane in a more uniform
way (as in the middle scatter plot of Figure 3). Then an UI was used to navigate the embedding space, and representative
regions were chosen as examples of grouped images from each film category.</p>


            <p>The used Arnold movies are from 1982 - 2002, and in to&shy;tal there are 15 of them. The full com&shy;pi&shy;la&shy;tion
is shown on the top left cor&shy;ner of Fig&shy;ure 10, along with zoomed in ex&shy;am&shy;ples. The top mid&shy;dle
im&shy;age has mainly ex&shy;plo&shy;sions and py&shy;rotech&shy;nics, along with the logo of <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures' class='external' target='_blank'>Columbia Pic&shy;tures</a>.
Ar&shy;guably the clouds on its back&shy;ground re&shy;sem&shy;ble a fire ball. Im&shy;ages on the top right are
close-ups of a sin&shy;gle face. The bot&shy;tom left cor&shy;ner has air&shy;planes and he&shy;li&shy;coptes, which are
clearly a very dis&shy;tinct and rec&shy;og&shy;nize&shy;able cat&shy;egory. The bot&shy;tom mid&shy;dle has peo&shy;ple
in a jun&shy;gle-like en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment. And fi&shy;nally the bot&shy;tom right has again peo&shy;ple, but this

hold&shy;ing sev&shy;eral kinds of ob&shy;jects such as a phone, play&shy;ing cards, pho&shy;tos or jew&shy;elry. The
bot&shy;tom left cor&shy;ner has one or more per&shy;sons in it, many times show&shy;ing some bare skin. In many of them
Mr. Bond is in bed, but there is also a pic&shy;ture of a sword swal&shy;lower in there. The bot&shy;tom mid&shy;dle has
close-ups on cars from var&shy;ious an&shy;gles, but in&shy;cludes also some he&shy;li&shy;copters and air&shy;planes.
Those im&shy;ages are so zoomed in that it is a bit hard to tell these ve&shy;hi&shy;cles apart. The bot&shy;tom right
