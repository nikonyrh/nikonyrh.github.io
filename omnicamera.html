            <p>My <a href='tag_master_s_thesis.html'>Mas&shy;ters of Sci&shy;ence The&shy;sis</a> in&shy;volved the us&shy;age of a
so-called "<a href='tag_omnidirectional_camera.html'>om&shy;ni&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tional cam&shy;era</a>". There are
vari&shy;ous ways of achiev&shy;ing 180&deg; or even 360&deg; view, with their dis&shy;tinct pros and cons. The
gen&shy;eral ben&shy;efit of these al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive cam&shy;era sys&shy;tems is that ob&shy;jects don't need
to be tracked, be&shy;cause gen&shy;er&shy;ally they stay with&shy;ing the ex&shy;tremely broad <a
href='tag_field_of_view.html'>Field of View</a> (FoV) of the cam&shy;era. This is also very ben&shy;efi&shy;cial in <a
href='tag_visual_odometry.html'>vi&shy;sual odom&shy;etry</a> tasks, be&shy;cause land&shy;marks can be tracked for
longer pe&shy;ri&shy;ods of time.</p>


            <p>Some de&shy;sign op&shy;tions are shown in Fig&shy;ure 1. The sim&shy;plest so&shy;lu&shy;tion is to use a fish-eye
lens, and it is fairly straight for&shy;ward to cal&shy;ibrate. How&shy;ever the im&shy;age res&shy;olu&shy;tion is
typ&shy;ically some&shy;what lim&shy;ited, and it can&shy;not cover much more than 180&deg;. An
al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive ap&shy;proach is to use mul&shy;ti&shy;ple nor&shy;mal cam&shy;eras, an com&shy;bine their
im&shy;ages in soft&shy;ware. This can pro&shy;duce very high res&shy;olu&shy;tion im&shy;ages, but re&shy;quires a lot
more ef&shy;fort and pa&shy;ram&shy;eters in cal&shy;ibra&shy;tion, es&shy;pe&shy;cially since also vinget&shy;ting
needs to be cor&shy;rected be&shy;fore im&shy;ages can be joined seam&shy;lessly to&shy;gether. There are
com&shy;mer&shy;cial prod&shy;ucts such as <a href='http://www.ptgrey.com/products/ladybug2' class='external'
target='_blank'>La&shy;dy&shy;bug</a> from Point&shy;Grey. The third op&shy;tion is to use a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion
of a tra&shy;di&shy;tional lens and a con&shy;cave mir&shy;ror to achieve up to 360&deg; &times; 90&deg; FoV. These are
rel&shy;atively com&shy;pact and mid-priced, with a bit lim&shy;ited res&shy;olu&shy;tion and a fairly sim&shy;ple
cal&shy;ibra&shy;tion mod&shy;els and pro&shy;ce&shy;dures. This is the type of cam&shy;era sys&shy;tem I used at my
Mas&shy;ter's The&shy;sis, which was ti&shy;tled <a href='http://autsys.aalto.fi/en/Publications/M45729'

            <p>The cam&shy;era sys&shy;tem I used in my the&shy;sis is pre&shy;sented in Fig&shy;ure 2. In ad&shy;di&shy;tion to the
om&shy;ni&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tional cam&shy;era sys&shy;tem, it has an <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit' class='external' target='_blank'>In&shy;er&shy;tial
Mea&shy;sure&shy;ment Unit</a> (IMU) and a sup&shy;port&shy;ing struc&shy;ture to at&shy;tach an com&shy;pact 2D laser
scan&shy;ner (40 &times; 40 mm) such as <a href='http://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/02sensor/07scanner/urg_04lx.html'
class='external' target='_blank'>Hokuyo URG</a>. This leaves us with a FoV of about 290&deg;, which is not an
prob&shy;lem be&shy;cause typ&shy;ically part of FoV would be blocked by the user or robot any&shy;way. Any&shy;way this
dark area can be ig&shy;nored dur&shy;ing im&shy;age rec&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion.</p>


            <p>One in&shy;tu&shy;itive im&shy;age rec&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion model is to make each im&shy;age pixel
cor&shy;re&shy;spond to an equal <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle' class='external'
target='_blank'>solid an&shy;gle</a>. For ex&shy;am&shy;ple if the cam&shy;era has a FoV of 360&deg; &times; 90&deg;,
suit&shy;able im&shy;age res&shy;olu&shy;tions would have res&shy;olu&shy;tions such as 360 &times; 90 and 720 &times;
180. To de&shy;ter&shy;mine the ac&shy;tual map&shy;ping, the cam&shy;era must be cal&shy;ibrated.</p>

            <p>One sim&shy;ple model was pre&shy;sented in [<a href='#cite:ocamlib'>1</a>], which is based on a kind of an radial basis
function to determine the z-component of the light ray (when camera is looking at the z-direction). This is illustrated
in Figure 4, and other illustrations can be seen in the original paper. In this model it is very easy to determine the
light ray's direction for each pixel, but it is more difficult to calculate the object's location on the image based on
its position in relation to the camera.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Let's first re&shy;vise how the typ&shy;ical per&shy;spec&shy;tive cam&shy;era is parametrized. The lin&shy;ear
pin&shy;hole cam&shy;era model is well de&shy;scribed in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_resectioning'
class='external' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>. It is im&shy;por&shy;tant to dif&shy;fer&shy;en&shy;ti&shy;ate
be&shy;tween in&shy;trin&shy;sic and ex&shy;trin&shy;sic pa&shy;ram&shy;eters. Ba&shy;si&shy;cally in&shy;trin&shy;sic
pa&shy;ram&shy;eters de&shy;scribe the phys&shy;ical as&shy;pects of the cam&shy;era and lens, such as fo&shy;cal length
and pixel den&shy;sity. Ex&shy;trin&shy;sic pa&shy;ram&shy;eters de&shy;scribe the lo&shy;ca&shy;tion and
ori&shy;en&shy;ta&shy;tion of the cam&shy;era in world co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nates. To de&shy;ter&shy;mine ob&shy;ject's
lo&shy;ca&shy;tion in the im&shy;age, first ex&shy;trin&shy;sic pa&shy;ram&shy;eters are used to de&shy;ter&shy;mine
ob&shy;ject's lo&shy;ca&shy;tion in cam&shy;era's co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nate sys&shy;tem. Then in&shy;trin&shy;sic
pa&shy;ram&shy;eters are used to pro&shy;ject the ob&shy;ject to the cam&shy;era's sen&shy;sor plane. To
de&shy;ter&shy;mine that which di&shy;rec&shy;tion a given pixel is ob&shy;serv&shy;ing, these steps are ap&shy;plied in
re&shy;verse or&shy;der. This model can&shy;not ac&shy;count for lens dis&shy;tor&shy;tion, nor it mod&shy;els
vi&shy;gnetting.</p>


            <p>This same model can&shy;not be ap&shy;plied to om&shy;ni&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tional cam&shy;eras, be&shy;cause it
op&shy;er&shy;ates on a fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tally dif&shy;fer&shy;ent prin&shy;ci&shy;ple.
In&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ingly the more generic model can be used to de&shy;scribe any cam&shy;era with a sin&shy;gle
view&shy;point prop&shy;erty, in&shy;clud&shy;ing per&shy;spec&shy;tive cam&shy;eras. For these it is also able to
ac&shy;count for lens dis&shy;tor&shy;tion.</p>


            <p>Start&shy;ing from a point on the im&shy;age, it is first trans&shy;formed via <a
href='tag_affine_transformation.html'>affine trans&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion</a> into a new co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nate
sys&shy;tem, in which the origin is close to the im&shy;age cen&shy;ter. This is es&shy;sen&shy;tially the same
parametriza&shy;tion as in the pin&shy;hole cam&shy;era model. Then the pixel's dis&shy;tance from the new origin is
de&shy;ter&shy;mined, and it is used to eval&shy;uate a low-de&shy;gree poly&shy;no&shy;mial func&shy;tion to
de&shy;ter&shy;mine the z-com&shy;po&shy;nent of the ray. Usu&shy;ally the poly&shy;no&shy;mial needs to have a higher
de&shy;gree than two, but not re&shy;ally greater than four.</p>


            <p>If the cam&shy;era is also able to see ''be&shy;hind'' it, then this poly&shy;no&shy;mial will get also neg&shy;ative
val&shy;ues. For an ideal pin&shy;hole cam&shy;era this func&shy;tion would just have con&shy;stant value, which
cor&shy;re&shy;sponds to the fo&shy;cal length of the lens (in pixel units). When lens dis&shy;tor&shy;tion is
pre&shy;sent, it will ei&shy;ther grow (for bar&shy;rel dis&shy;tor&shy;tion) or de&shy;crease (for pin&shy;cush&shy;ion
dis&shy;tori&shy;ton) as the pix&shy;els are fur&shy;ther away from the cen&shy;ter. Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less for
nor&shy;mal lenses it will not de&shy;vi&shy;ate that much from its value at the origin.  There can be greater changes
for fisheye lenses.</p>


            <p>For the used om&shy;ni&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tional sys&shy;tem this func&shy;tion started from a big pos&shy;itive value,
reached 0 at a dis&shy;tance of \tex&shy;tasci&shy;itilde 500 pix&shy;els and grows to pos&shy;itive af&shy;ter that.
This means that pix&shy;els near the im&shy;age cen&shy;ter are ac&shy;tu&shy;ally gath&shy;er&shy;ing light be&shy;hind
the cam&shy;era, or in case the cam&shy;era is pointed up&shy;wards, these pix&shy;els are see&shy;ing the ground.
Cor&shy;re&shy;spond&shy;ingly pix&shy;els near the im&shy;age bor&shy;der are gath&shy;er&shy;ing light above the
hori&shy;zon.</p>


            <p>To use this cal&shy;ibra&shy;tion data for gen&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ing a panoramic im&shy;age in which each pixel
cov&shy;ers the equal solid an&shy;gle, this map&shy;ping func&shy;tion needs to be used to de&shy;ter&shy;mine the
az&shy;imuth an&shy;gle for each pixel dis&shy;tance. This is cal&shy;cu&shy;lated as &alpha;(r) =
arc&shy;tan(<sup>f(r)</sup>&frasl;<sub>r</sub>), which clearly does not have a closed form so&shy;lu&shy;tion. The
re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship be&shy;tween f(r) and &alpha;(r) can be seen in Fig&shy;ure 5 for f(r) = 400 - 0.2 r - 0.002
r<sup>2</sup>.</p>
