            <p>As men&shy;tioned in an other ar&shy;ti&shy;cle about <a
href='tag_omnidirectional_camera.html'>om&shy;ni&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tional cam&shy;eras</a>, my <a
href='tag_master_s_thesis.html'>Mas&shy;ter's The&shy;sis</a>' main topic was real-time in&shy;ter&shy;est point
ex&shy;trac&shy;tion and track&shy;ing on an om&shy;ni&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tional im&shy;age in a chal&shy;leng&shy;ing
forest en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment. I found OpenCV's rou&shy;ti&shy;nes mostly rather slow and run&shy;ning in a
sin&shy;gle thread, so I ended up im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ing ev&shy;ery&shy;thing my&shy;self to gain more con&shy;trol
on the data flow and threads' de&shy;pen&shy;den&shy;cies. The im&shy;ple&shy;mented code would
si&shy;mul&shy;ta&shy;ne&shy;ously use 4 threads on CPU and a few hun&shy;dred on the GPU, ex&shy;ecut&shy;ing
in&shy;ter&shy;est point ex&shy;trac&shy;tion and match&shy;ing at 27 fps (37 ms/frame) for 1800 &times; 360 pix&shy;els
(&asymp;0.65 Mpix) panoramic im&shy;age.</p>


            <p>In the topic of <a href='tag_visual_odometry.html'>vi&shy;sual odom&shy;etry</a>, in&shy;ter&shy;est point
ex&shy;trac&shy;tion and match&shy;ing is a cru&shy;cial step, and it is no sur&shy;prise that this is a widely
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gated topic. Some meth&shy;ods are op&shy;ti&shy;mized for speed where as oth&shy;ers are
op&shy;ti&shy;mized for most ac&shy;cu&shy;rate re&shy;sults. Also there are sev&shy;eral dif&shy;fer&shy;ent types of
er&shy;rors (in&shy;ter&shy;est point drift&shy;ing, in&shy;cor&shy;rect matches etc.), and how much the sys&shy;tem
re&shy;lies on a-pri&shy;ori knowl&shy;edge which was ex&shy;tracted at pre&shy;vi&shy;ous frames. Also some
ad&shy;di&shy;tional sen&shy;sors such as In&shy;er&shy;tial Mea&shy;sure&shy;ment Unit (IMU) might be avail&shy;able,
and the most com&shy;pu&shy;ta&shy;tion&shy;ally ef&shy;fi&shy;cient rely on ac&shy;cu&shy;rate a-pri&shy;ori
in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion and re&shy;li&shy;able read&shy;ings from an IMU to have very good ini&shy;tial guesses on
where in&shy;ter&shy;est points should be found from the next frame. How&shy;ever these meth&shy;ods are less
gen&shy;eral, and are more dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to gen&shy;er&shy;al&shy;ize and to ap&shy;ply in new
sit&shy;ua&shy;tions. In ad&shy;di&shy;tion, many vi&shy;sual odom&shy;etry sys&shy;tems use stereo vi&shy;sion
in&shy;stead of just a sin&shy;gle cam&shy;era, and this also in&shy;tro&shy;duces its own dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ties
but also ad&shy;van&shy;tages.</p>


            <p>In my the&shy;sis and in this ar&shy;ti&shy;cle I only fo&shy;cus on monoc&shy;ular vi&shy;sion al&shy;go&shy;rithms
with no a-pri&shy;ori knowl&shy;edge of the in&shy;ter&shy;est points, en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment or the mo&shy;tion
be&shy;tween frames. Also I won't de&shy;scribe stan&shy;dard in&shy;ter&shy;est point al&shy;go&shy;rithms such as <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform' class='external' target='_blank'>SIFT</a> or <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SURF' class='external' target='_blank'>SURF</a>, be&shy;cause they are well
de&shy;scribed in Wikipedia and are dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to ro&shy;bustly ap&shy;ply in real-time sce&shy;nar&shy;ios.
They are com&shy;pu&shy;ta&shy;tion&shy;ally in&shy;ten&shy;sive to ex&shy;tract and match, and don't have many
ad&shy;justable pa&shy;ram&shy;eters to ease the com&shy;pu&shy;ta&shy;tional cost. Of course there are
nu&shy;mer&shy;ous oth&shy;ers al&shy;go&shy;rithms as well, but typ&shy;ically they have quite poor scale and
ro&shy;ta&shy;tion in&shy;vari&shy;ance.</p>


            <p>The al&shy;go&shy;rithm I came up with starts by con&shy;vert&shy;ing the ob&shy;served cir&shy;cu&shy;lar
om&shy;ni&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tional im&shy;age into a equian&shy;gu&shy;lar panorama of  de&shy;sired
res&shy;olu&shy;tion, such as 1800 &times; 360 pix&shy;els. This as&shy;pect ra&shy;tio cor&shy;re&shy;sponds
ap&shy;prox&shy;imately to the <a href='tag_field_of_view.html'>field of view</a> of the cam&shy;era, which in this case
was 360&deg; &times; (11 + 62)&deg;. These di&shy;men&shy;sions have small prime fac&shy;tor
de&shy;com&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tions (2<sup>3</sup> &times; 3<sup>2</sup> &times; 5<sup>2</sup> and 2<sup>3</sup> &times;
3<sup>2</sup> &times; 5), which is important for an efficient FFT calculation. The original circular image and the
resulting panorama can be seen in Figure 1.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The in&shy;ter&shy;est point ex&shy;trac&shy;tion is based on the stan&shy;dard <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_Laplacian_of_Gaussian' class='external'
target='_blank'>Lapla&shy;cian of Gaus&shy;sian</a> (LoG) blob de&shy;tec&shy;tor. Its ben&shy;efits in&shy;clude
ex&shy;cel&shy;lent scale and ro&shy;ta&shy;tion in&shy;vari&shy;ance, able to ro&shy;bustly di&shy;vide
in&shy;ter&shy;est points into two dif&shy;fer&shy;ent classes (dark and bright blobs), are very sta&shy;ble and are
plenty to be found in nat&shy;ural en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ments. Per&shy;haps the only down-side is that it gives
un&shy;sta&shy;ble re&shy;sponse also along edges, but these are easy to de&shy;tect and fil&shy;ter. One sim&shy;ple
al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive would have been some of the nu&shy;mer&shy;ous cor&shy;ner de&shy;tec&shy;tors, but they have
only one class of de&shy;tected points, are prone to im&shy;age blur and cor&shy;ners are more dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to
ob&shy;serve in na&shy;ture.</p>


            <p>The <a href='tag_sift.html'>SIFT</a> de&shy;tec&shy;tor ap&shy;prox&shy;imates Lapla&shy;cian of Gaus&shy;sian via
Dif&shy;fer&shy;ence of Gaus&shy;sian, which is based on cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing dif&shy;fer&shy;ences be&shy;tween

class='external' target='_blank'>Cen&shy;ter Sur&shy;round Ex&shy;tremas for Re&shy;al&shy;time Fea&shy;ture
De&shy;tec&shy;tion and Match&shy;ing</a>) is based on ap&shy;prox&shy;imat&shy;ing DoG by spend&shy;ing ef&shy;fort in
cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing slanted in&shy;te&shy;gral im&shy;ages, which can be then used to cal&shy;cu&shy;late
con&shy;vo&shy;lu&shy;tions of ar&shy;bi&shy;trary large ar&shy;eas in a con&shy;stant time, but also has its own
trade-offs.</p>


            <p>The ex&shy;trac&shy;tion al&shy;go&shy;rithm was im&shy;ple&shy;mented a quad-core pro&shy;ces&shy;sor in mind, and this
is re&shy;flected in all steps. Most of the time is spent on pro&shy;cess&shy;ing the most de&shy;tailed level of the
im&shy;age pyra&shy;mid, and the smaller pyra&shy;mid lev&shy;els aren't that sig&shy;nif&shy;icant. The first two steps
are shown in Fig&shy;ure 2. At the first step the LoG is cal&shy;cu&shy;lated at four dif&shy;fer&shy;ent scales in
par&shy;al&shy;lel, uti&shy;liz&shy;ing the FFTW li&shy;brary. LoG could be im&shy;ple&shy;mented as a stan&shy;dard
con&shy;vo&shy;lu&shy;tion over the im&shy;age, but this would make it suit&shy;able only for small ker&shy;nels.
In&shy;stead when cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing the con&shy;vo&shy;lu&shy;tion via for&shy;ward Fourier trans&shy;form,
el&shy;ement-wise mul&shy;ti&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion and in&shy;verse Fourier Trans&shy;form the run&shy;time doesn't
de&shy;pend on the cho&shy;sen scale &sigma;. Also scal&shy;ing the re&shy;sponse by a con&shy;stant is done for
''free'', be&shy;cause the ap&shy;plied mask can be pre-mul&shy;ti&shy;plied by the de&shy;sired amount.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Once LoG re&shy;sponses have been cal&shy;cu&shy;lated, the lo&shy;cal scale-space min&shy;ima and max&shy;ima are
searched. Only the mid&shy;dle two lay&shy;ers can be searched, and also they have a margin at their bor&shy;ders. These
mar&shy;gins are in&shy;di&shy;cated by the pink color in Fig&shy;ure 2. Each pixel is com&shy;pared against its 5 + 8 +
5 neigh&shy;bors (in&shy;di&shy;cated in gray), to de&shy;ter&shy;mine if all of them are ei&shy;ther smaller or larger
than the pixel's value. The pixel is first com&shy;pared against its neigh&shy;bors within the same scale, to
bet&shy;ter uti&shy;lize caches of the pro&shy;ces&shy;sor. To keep all four cores busy, each core is
re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble for find&shy;ing lo&shy;cal ex&shy;trema from one half of an im&shy;age. Found ex&shy;trema
need to be fil&shy;tered for edge re&shy;sponses and those which have too low lo&shy;cal con&shy;trast.</p>


            <p>Once in&shy;ter&shy;est points have been found, de&shy;scrip&shy;tors can be ex&shy;tracted.
Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nately my novel al&shy;go&shy;rithm haven't been pub&shy;lished yet, and thus I won't re&shy;veal
all the de&shy;tails yet. But I can say that the over&shy;all de&shy;scrip&shy;tors are ex&shy;tremely fast to
cal&shy;cu&shy;late, affine-in&shy;vari&shy;ant(!), highly ro&shy;bust and their match&shy;ing fits well in the CUDA
pro&shy;gram&shy;ming model. The num&shy;ber of de&shy;scrip&shy;tors is 10&times; &#8212; 20&times; of the num&shy;ber
of in&shy;ter&shy;est points, but a very good heuris&shy;tic ex&shy;ists to ef&shy;fi&shy;ciently ig&shy;nore most of
the im&shy;plau&shy;si&shy;ble matches with lit&shy;tle ex&shy;tra cost. This is mostly true for the case when a
rel&shy;atively high-frame rate video feed is an&shy;alyzed.</p>


            <p>In the im&shy;ple&shy;mented track&shy;ing sys&shy;tem, GPU is used to match frames 1 and 2 while CPU is busy
ex&shy;tract&shy;ing fea&shy;tures from frame 3. Thus the frame rate is de&shy;ter&shy;mined by the slow&shy;est
com&shy;po&shy;nent of the sys&shy;tem. This de&shy;pends on the im&shy;age res&shy;olu&shy;tion and var&shy;ious other
pa&shy;ram&shy;eters, but typ&shy;ically these are quite bal&shy;anced.</p>


            <p>I have ran ex&shy;ten&shy;sive com&shy;par&shy;isons of this al&shy;go&shy;rithm against the pop&shy;ular <a
href='tag_surf.html'>SURF</a>, and found out my al&shy;go&shy;rithm gain&shy;ing a lot lower er&shy;ror rates in
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent match&shy;ing sce&shy;nar&shy;ios. The used dataset was the well-known <a
href='http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/' class='external' target='_blank'>Leu&shy;ven</a>, which has a
good set of dif&shy;fer&shy;ent im&shy;age dis&shy;tor&shy;tions such as blur, view&shy;point change and zoom +

            <p>Since the de&shy;scrip&shy;tor match&shy;ing is based on a vot&shy;ing scheme, it proved to be a very ro&shy;bust in
match&shy;ing task. Two dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ways of match&shy;ing were eval&shy;uated. The first one is based on
match&shy;ing each in&shy;ter&shy;est point to its clos&shy;est match, and the other one is based on thresh&shy;old
match&shy;ing, where a point is con&shy;sid&shy;ered match&shy;ing to which ever point if this sim&shy;ilar&shy;ity
thresh&shy;old is ex&shy;ceeded. The first cri&shy;te&shy;ria is eval&shy;uated on a ''1 - pre&shy;ci&shy;sion'' and
cor&shy;rect pos&shy;itive match&shy;ing rate, and the other one is on false pos&shy;itive rate ver&shy;sus false
neg&shy;ative rate. On the sec&shy;ond graph EER stands for ''equal er&shy;ror rate'', in which the
prob&shy;abil&shy;ity of false neg&shy;ative is equal to the prob&shy;abil&shy;ity of false pos&shy;itive.</p>

            <p>The per&shy;for&shy;mance for boat se&shy;quence is shown in Fig&shy;ure 4. In all sce&shy;nar&shy;ios the novel
al&shy;go&shy;rithm gained bet&shy;ter ac&shy;cu&shy;racy than SURF, es&shy;pe&shy;cially for those im&shy;ages which
had the least dif&shy;fer&shy;ence in scale. The graf&shy;fiti se&shy;quence re&shy;sulted in sim&shy;ilar re&shy;sults,
as can be seen in Fig&shy;ure 5. I hope that in fu&shy;ture I'll get this al&shy;go&shy;rithm prop&shy;erly
pub&shy;lished, and then it can be re&shy;viewed by also other peers in the sci&shy;en&shy;tific com&shy;mu&shy;nity.</p>
