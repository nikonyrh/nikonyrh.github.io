            <p>So far I've writ&shy;ten a ba&shy;sic ren&shy;der&shy;ing en&shy;gine which uses <a href='http://www.nvidia.com'
class='external' target='_blank'>Nvidia</a>'s <a href='http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html' class='external'
target='_blank'>CUDA</a> (Com&shy;pute Uni&shy;fied De&shy;vice Ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;ture) which can ren&shy;der
re&shy;flec&shy;tive sur&shy;faces with en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;men&shy;tal map&shy;ping and anti-alias&shy;ing and
mo&shy;tion blur at 200 fps with min&shy;imal us&shy;age of 3<sup>rd</sup> party li&shy;braries such as OpenGL. This let
me fully im&shy;ple&shy;ment the cross-plat&shy;form ren&shy;der&shy;ing pipeline from data trans&shy;fer to pixel-level
RGB cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tions, all in C-like syn&shy;tax.</p>


            <p>An ex&shy;am&shy;ple ren&shy;dered frame can be seen in Fig&shy;ure 1. Cubes aren't tex&shy;tured, but that would be
fairly easy to im&shy;ple&shy;ment since CUDA sup&shy;ports fil&shy;tered tex&shy;ture lookups. How&shy;ever I'm likely
to im&shy;ple&shy;ment pro&shy;ce&shy;du&shy;ral vol&shy;umet&shy;ric tex&shy;tures, be&shy;cause the game&shy;play lets
the user to ar&shy;bi&shy;trary slice the ob&shy;ject by draw&shy;ing the cut&shy;ting plane by mouse. If the
ob&shy;jects were tex&shy;tured, then I'd need to im&shy;ple&shy;ment also gen&shy;er&shy;ation of UV
co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nates and tex&shy;ture bitmaps.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The an&shy;tialias&shy;ing is im&shy;ple&shy;mented by hav&shy;ing the CUDA thread to su&shy;per&shy;sam&shy;ple each
pixel, and store the av&shy;er&shy;aged re&shy;sult. These re&shy;sults can be seen in Fig&shy;ure 2. In
ad&shy;di&shy;tion the used sam&shy;pling pat&shy;tern is mir&shy;rored be&shy;tween frames and the im&shy;age is
av&shy;er&shy;aged with the pre&shy;vi&shy;ous im&shy;age, so in prac&shy;tice the 4x sam&shy;pling pro&shy;duces
re&shy;sults which are sim&shy;ilar to a more com&shy;pu&shy;ta&shy;tion&shy;ally de&shy;mand&shy;ing 8x sam&shy;pling.
This has the ad&shy;di&shy;tional ad&shy;van&shy;tage of hav&shy;ing the pos&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity of
in&shy;ter&shy;po&shy;lat&shy;ing the sub-sam&shy;pling di&shy;rec&shy;tion based on cam&shy;era mo&shy;tion since the
pre&shy;vi&shy;ous frame to sim&shy;ulate mo&shy;tion blur on the back&shy;ground. This is demon&shy;strated in
Fig&shy;ure 3. This com&shy;bined with very high fram&shy;er&shy;ate re&shy;sults in a very smooth user

            <p>CUDA threads op&shy;er&shy;ate in blocks of 16 &times; 16 = 256 threads in to&shy;tal, one thread / screen pixel. If the
out&shy;put res&shy;olu&shy;tion is 1280 &times; 720, there are <sup>1280</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times;
<sup>720</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> = 80 &times; 45 = 3600 blocks to render.  The number of active blocks depends on the
hardware, but the used hardware (Nvidia GeForce GT 650M, maximum of 2048 threads) achieved a high occypancy quite
easily. This is illustraded in Figure 4. If the thread block has to check ray-triangle collisions with only a single
triangle, then it is encoded in blue, otherwise in red. Interestingly this can be solved quite efficiently in CPU as a
pre-step for the rendering, by projecting the triangle corners to screen pixels and doing the checks purely in 2D.</p>

Each block has 256 threads, one for each pixel. When an&shy;tialias&shy;ing is used, each thread is it&shy;er&shy;ated mul&shy;ti&shy;ple times to de&shy;ter&shy;mine the av&shy;er&shy;age color for the pixel. Pix&shy;els out&shy;side bound&shy;ing box can be ren&shy;dered with less ef&shy;fort, be&shy;cause only the back&shy;ground needs to be ren&shy;dered.

            </div>

            <p>If the mod&shy;els con&shy;sist of large poly&shy;gons, then each thread block needs to do only a few
ray-tri&shy;an&shy;gle in&shy;ter&shy;sec&shy;tion tests. Also if that block does not con&shy;tain any ob&shy;jects, the
block doesn't need to ren&shy;der any&shy;thing but the back&shy;ground, ei&shy;ther by pro&shy;ce&shy;du&shy;ral
cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tions or by a sim&shy;ple tex&shy;ture lookup. The ren&shy;der&shy;ing is im&shy;ple&shy;mented as
first ren&shy;der&shy;ing just plain back&shy;ground for the whole screen, and then have sec&shy;ond pass on the
re&shy;gion which con&shy;tains ren&shy;der&shy;able ob&shy;jects.</p>


            <p>Ide&shy;ally the ren&shy;dered out&shy;put would be dis&shy;played at the screen di&shy;rectly us&shy;ing OpenGL, but
un&shy;four&shy;tu&shy;nately I haven't been able to get this work&shy;ing yet. The cur&shy;rent work-around is to copy
the re&shy;sult&shy;ing im&shy;age from GPU to a SDL sur&shy;face (in CPU's RAM), and then use a sur&shy;face blit
op&shy;er&shy;ation to dis&shy;play it on the screen. This adds a bit ex&shy;tra over&shy;head, but could be eas&shy;ily
refac&shy;tored by some&shy;one who is more fa&shy;mil&shy;iar with CUDA/OpenGL in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion, and there is
even an ar&shy;ti&shy;cle ''<a href='http://3dgep.com/?p=2082' class='external' target='_blank'>OpenGL
In&shy;ter&shy;op&shy;er&shy;abil&shy;ity with CUDA</a>''.</p>


            <p>The slic&shy;ing pro&shy;cess can be seen in Fig&shy;ure 5. By spec&shy;ify&shy;ing two points in the screen space,
based on vir&shy;tual cam&shy;era's pa&shy;ram&shy;eter it can be de&shy;ter&shy;mined that in which di&shy;rec&shy;tion
in world co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nates the two points are point&shy;ing at. By tak&shy;ing a cross pro&shy;duct of these
vec&shy;tors, we get the nor&shy;mal of the split&shy;ting plane. By know&shy;ing that the plane goes through the
vir&shy;tual cam&shy;era's fo&shy;cal point, we have full knowl&shy;edge of its equa&shy;tion. Then all ver&shy;tices of
the mod&shy;els can be checked if its end&shy;points are in dif&shy;fer&shy;ent sides of the plane or not. If they are,
the whole tri&shy;an&shy;gle is flagged as be&shy;ing af&shy;fected by the split&shy;ting ac&shy;tion.</p>

            <div style='padding-top: 32px; padding-bottom: 32px; text-align: center'>
                <a href='CudaRendering_slicing.jpg' class='lightbox'>
                    <img class='figure' align='center' width='97%' src='CudaRendering_slicing.jpg' alt='slicing'/>
                </a><br/>
                <div style='padding-top: 16px; max-width: 95%; text-align: justify; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'>
                    <b>Figure 5</b>: As shown on the left, the user can de&shy;fine a split&shy;ting plane, along which the ob&shy;ject will be sliced and have its mesh re&shy;fined. Af&shy;fected tri&shy;an&shy;gles are high&shy;lighted in red. A re&shy;sult of mul&shy;ti&shy;lple slic&shy;ings is shown on the right. Dur&shy;ing the game&shy;play these holes would be au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;ically cov&shy;ered.
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The ac&shy;tual split&shy;ting works by re&shy;fin&shy;ing each tri&shy;an&shy;gle into three sub-tri&shy;an&shy;gles,
one of which will be deleted by the split&shy;ting ac&shy;tion. Af&shy;ter all tri&shy;an&shy;gles have been
re&shy;fined, those edges which only have one linked tri&shy;an&shy;gle form the perime&shy;ter of the hole. At this
point a proper tri&shy;an&shy;gu&shy;la&shy;tion needs to be au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;ically gen&shy;er&shy;ated to fill
the hole, and this should try to max&shy;imize the min&shy;imum an&shy;gle of all re&shy;sult&shy;ing
tri&shy;an&shy;gles.</p>


            <p>The out&shy;come of this al&shy;go&shy;rithm is a valid mesh, but typ&shy;ically it has many re&shy;dun&shy;dant
ver&shy;tices which could be pruned. How&shy;ever so far I haven't been able to im&shy;ple&shy;ment the
pro&shy;ce&shy;dure of re&shy;fin&shy;ing the mesh while it&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ing through it, be&shy;cause data
struc&shy;tures be&shy;come tem&shy;porar&shy;ily in&shy;con&shy;sis&shy;tent. Maybe an eas&shy;ier so&shy;lu&shy;tion
would be to copy the old struc&shy;ture into a tem&shy;po&shy;rary vari&shy;able, and then re-cre&shy;ate the
op&shy;ti&shy;mized mesh from scratch. With&shy;out this op&shy;ti&shy;miza&shy;tion the mesh be&shy;comes
un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;ily com&shy;plex af&shy;ter 4 to 6 split&shy;ting ac&shy;tions.</p>
