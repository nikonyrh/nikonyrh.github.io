            <p>Hu&shy;mans are nat&shy;urally ca&shy;pa&shy;ble of sep&shy;arat&shy;ing an ob&shy;ject from the back&shy;ground of an
im&shy;age, or speech from mu&shy;sic on an au&shy;dio clip. Photo edit&shy;ing is an easy task, but
per&shy;son&shy;ally I don't know how to re&shy;move mu&shy;sic from the back&shy;ground. A first ap&shy;proach would be
to use band-pass fil&shy;ters, but it wouldn't re&shy;sult in a sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tory end re&shy;sult since there
is so much over&shy;lap be&shy;tween the fre&shy;quen&shy;cies. This ar&shy;ti&shy;cle de&shy;scripbes a
su&shy;per&shy;vised learn&shy;ing ap&shy;proach on solv&shy;ing this prob&shy;lem.</p>


            <p>The used dataset con&shy;sists of four sep&shy;arate pod&shy;casts (8.4 hours in to&shy;tal) and four
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent gen&shy;res of mu&shy;sic (ide&shy;ally with&shy;out any lyrics, 7.1 hours in to&shy;tal). The used

            <p>All au&shy;dio files have a sam&shy;pling rate of 44.1 kHz, which was down&shy;sam&shy;pled by 1:3 to 14.7 kHz to speed
up the net&shy;work train&shy;ing. They were loaded to Python us&shy;ing <a href='https://pypi.org/project/pydub/'
class='external' target='_blank'>Py&shy;dub</a>, which is a wrap&shy;per for the FFM&shy;PEG. The files were split into
two sec&shy;ond long clips, and were nor&shy;mal&shy;ized so that their stan&shy;dard de&shy;vi&shy;ations are one. The
in&shy;put to the net&shy;work is a mu&shy;sic clip + a weighted ran&shy;dom speech clip, where the weight was picked
uni&shy;formly from the in&shy;ter&shy;val of [0, 1]. So there are three types of clips (mu&shy;sic, speech and
com&shy;bined), and their av&shy;er&shy;aged spec&shy;trums are shown in Fig&shy;ure 1.</p>

Ob&shy;vi&shy;ously the "com&shy;bined" class is found be&shy;tween the two other classes, since Fourier trans&shy;form is a lin&shy;ear op&shy;er&shy;ation (al&shy;though the plots are nor&shy;mal&shy;ized, their mean is one). The mu&shy;sic is higher on the 100 - 400 Hz range, and speech is higher be&shy;tween 400 and 3000 Hz.

            <p>Split&shy;ting the 8.4 hours of pod&shy;casts into sam&shy;ples of two sec&shy;onds pro&shy;duced 15254 clips, of which
20% was used for model val&shy;ida&shy;tion. The in&shy;put (1 chan&shy;nel) and ex&shy;pected out&shy;put (2
chan&shy;nels) is stored in a ma&shy;trix of shape 15254 &times; 29400 &times; 3, which re&shy;quires only 5.4 GB of
mem&shy;ory when stored in <span class=sourcecode>float32</span> for&shy;mat. This fits eas&shy;ily in RAM, but much
more would be needed if more dif&shy;fer&shy;ent pod&shy;casts were in&shy;cluded, or the orig&shy;inal sam&shy;pling
rate of 44.1 kHz was used. Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less there are about 360 mil&shy;lion data points used for
train&shy;ing, and the loss is cal&shy;cu&shy;lated against 720 mil&shy;lion data points.</p>


            <p>Nat&shy;urally sev&shy;eral net&shy;work ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;tures were ex&shy;per&shy;imented with, but here just
the best one is de&shy;scribed. It has three tun&shy;able hy&shy;per&shy;pa&shy;ram&shy;eters, and they were cho&shy;sen
so that the num&shy;ber of model pa&shy;ram&shy;eters was ap&shy;prox&shy;imately 2 mil&shy;lion. The net&shy;work
at&shy;tempts to nor&shy;mal&shy;ize the in&shy;com&shy;ing sig&shy;nal's vol&shy;ume (the vari&shy;able <span
class=sourcecode>stds</span>) and re-scale the out&shy;put back to the orig&shy;inal level, but ex&shy;per&shy;iments
show that for some rea&shy;son this isn't work&shy;ing as ex&shy;pected.</p>

            <p>On a GTX 1080TI each epoch took 13.8 min&shy;utes, but up&shy;grad&shy;ing it to a RTX 3070TI (pay&shy;ing +100% over
MSRP) re&shy;duced this by 58%, bring&shy;ing it down to 5.8 min&shy;utes. Any&shy;how, the eval&shy;uated net&shy;work
was trained with the older GPU, and full con&shy;ver&shy;gence took 105 epochs or 24.2 hours! Sep&shy;arate <a
href='https://keras.io/api/callbacks/early_stopping/' class='external' target='_blank'>EarlyStop&shy;ping</a>
call&shy;backs were used for <span class=sourcecode>loss</span> and <span class=sourcecode>val_loss</span> met&shy;rics,
and <a href='https://keras.io/api/optimizers/adam/' class='external' target='_blank'>Adam's</a> learn&shy;ing rate was
ad&shy;justed down from 10<sup>-2.5</sup> to 10<sup>-3.5</sup> and 10<sup>-4</sup> automatically by <a
href='https://keras.io/api/callbacks/reduce_lr_on_plateau/' class='external'
target='_blank'>Re&shy;duceL&shy;ROn&shy;Plateau</a>. The model was trained to a Mean Squared Error of 0.0585 for train
and 0.0663 for validation.</p>


            <p>The vari&shy;ance of the ref&shy;er&shy;ence mu&shy;sic sig&shy;nal was 1.0 as ex&shy;pected by the
nor&shy;mal&shy;iza&shy;tion, but for speech it was only 0.33! Since the speech's weight is a ran&shy;dom uni&shy;form
vari&shy;able with a mean of 0.5, it was ex&shy;pected that the sig&shy;nal's mean was 0.5 as well. It was then noted
that the used nor&shy;mal&shy;iza&shy;tion is <span class=sourcecode>x /= max(1, x.std())</span>, mean&shy;ing that
quiet sig&shy;nals aren't go&shy;ing to be am&shy;pli&shy;fied. The same for&shy;mula was used for mu&shy;sic, but it is
plau&shy;si&shy;ble that a con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion have quiet pe&shy;ri&shy;ods of a few sec&shy;onds. Sum&shy;ming
these two un&shy;cor&shy;re&shy;lated sig&shy;nals to&shy;gether pro&shy;duces the in&shy;put to the net&shy;work, with
an av&shy;er&shy;age vari&shy;ance of 1.33. Com&shy;par&shy;ing this with the MSE loss, it is seen that the model is
able to cor&shy;rectly model about 95% of the vari&shy;ance. Ex&shy;am&shy;ple in&shy;puts and out&shy;puts are shown in

            <p>The used er&shy;ror ma&shy;tric was just the plain MSE, which doesn't cor&shy;re&shy;sponds well on how the
gen&shy;er&shy;ated sig&shy;nal sounds to a hu&shy;man ear. A bet&shy;ter stan&shy;dard would be the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_Evaluation_of_Audio_Quality' class='external'
target='_blank'>Per&shy;cep&shy;tual Eval&shy;ua&shy;tion of Au&shy;dio Qual&shy;ity</a> or <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_Evaluation_of_Speech_Quality' class='external' target='_blank'>... Speech
Qual&shy;ity</a>. The lat&shy;ter is im&shy;ple&shy;mented in a Python li&shy;brary <a
href='https://pypi.org/project/pesq/' class='external' target='_blank'>python-pesq</a>, which could be used for model
eval&shy;ua&shy;tion. But since it isn't dif&shy;fer&shy;en&shy;tiable, it can&shy;not be used as the model's loss
func&shy;tion.</p>


            <p>There is also a <a href='https://github.com/pranaymanocha/PerceptualAudio' class='external' target='_blank'>Deep
Per&shy;cep&shy;tual Au&shy;dio Met&shy;ric (DPAM)</a> (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04460' class='external'
target='_blank'>Arxiv</a>) metric, which is actually differentiable! However it wasn't tested, mainly because it doesn't
support Tensorflow 2.x and it requires a different sampling rate (22050 Hz, all experiments were done with 44100 / 3 =
14700 Hz).</p>


            <p>Yet an other ap&shy;proach would be to train a net&shy;work to cal&shy;cu&shy;late the sig&shy;nal's <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram' class='external' target='_blank'>spec&shy;togram</a>, and then use it
as a loss (with frozen weights) in sig&shy;nal re&shy;con&shy;struc&shy;tion. I have no idea whether it would work as a
stand-alone loss, or it should be used alongside with MSE. In&shy;tu&shy;ition tells me that if the
spec&shy;tro&shy;gram matches, then it should sound good re&shy;gard&shy;less of phase shift etc.</p>

            <p>White noise (also known as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise' class='external'

of&shy;ten used as a "test in&shy;put" to a sig&shy;nal pro&shy;cess&shy;ing unit or an al&shy;go&shy;rithm. Fig&shy;ure
4 shows that what per&shy;cent&shy;age of each fre&shy;quency range gets passed to the "mu&shy;sic" or "speech"
out&shy;put. The net&shy;work isn't con&shy;strained to pre&shy;serve the to&shy;tal en&shy;ergy, so the sum of the two
out&shy;puts may have a higher vari&shy;ance than the in&shy;put sig&shy;nal. Ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to <a
href='https://blog.accusonus.com/pro-audio-production/human-voice-frequency-range/' class='external'
target='_blank'>Ac&shy;cu&shy;sonus.com</a>, hu&shy;man speech spans from a range of 125 Hz to 8000 Hz. Ear&shy;lier on
Fig&shy;ure 1 it was seen that this dataset's speech is dis&shy;tinct from mu&shy;sic at around fre&shy;quen&shy;cies
be&shy;tween 300 and 3000 Hz. But it should be noted that this dataset doesn't have any woman or child speak&shy;ers.
Those would be re&shy;ally good test cases for ad&shy;di&shy;tional model val&shy;ida&shy;tion.</p>


            <p>The net&shy;work's re&shy;sponse to white noise of vary&shy;ing am&shy;pli&shy;tudes is shown in Fig&shy;ure 4. 80 - 99%
of the sig&shy;nal is passed to the "mu&shy;sic" out&shy;put and the rest to the "speech" out&shy;put. As ex&shy;pected,
the speech out&shy;put is strongest at fre&shy;quen&shy;cies be&shy;tween 300 and 1000 Hz. The net&shy;work was
in&shy;tended to be co&shy;vari&shy;ant (or lin&shy;ear) in re&shy;spect to the in&shy;put sig&shy;nal's vol&shy;ume,

don't get passed to the "speech" out&shy;put as a stand-alone sig&shy;nal. It seems that the net&shy;work has learned
some pat&shy;terns in speech, and it only lets those pass through. It is also un&shy;clear why the net&shy;work

            <p>The in&shy;put has 29400 sam&shy;ples, but the out&shy;put has only 27864 (768 &middot; 2 = 1536 fewer). This
hap&shy;pens be&shy;cause the net&shy;work uses <span class=sourcecode>Conv1D</span> lay&shy;ers with&shy;out padding,
so at each layer the out&shy;put gets a lit&shy;tle smaller. Be&shy;cause of this, ex&shy;tra care has to be taken when
pro&shy;cess&shy;ing longer in&shy;put se&shy;quences. The first in&shy;put is sam&shy;ples from 0 to 29399
(in&shy;clu&shy;sive), but the sec&shy;ond in&shy;put is not from 29400 to 58799! In&shy;stead the "crop fac&shy;tor"
has to be taken into ac&shy;count, so the sec&shy;ond range is shifted left by 768. This gives us 29400 - 768 to 2
&middot; 29400 - 768 - 1, or 28632 to 58031. The third range is from 2 &middot; 29400 - 768 to 3 &middot; 29400 - 2
&middot; 768 - 1. Also the model doesn't give pre&shy;dic&shy;tions to the first 768 sam&shy;ples, so the pre&shy;dicted
out&shy;put has to be padded with that many ze&shy;ros (ac&shy;tu&shy;ally I for&shy;got to do the padding, so
au&shy;dio tracks are a bit out of sync).</p>
