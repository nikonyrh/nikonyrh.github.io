            <p>Soft&shy;ware pro&shy;jects are typ&shy;ically "tracked" on a ver&shy;sion con&shy;trol sys&shy;tem (<a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control' class='external' target='_blank'>VCS</a>). Each "ver&shy;sion" of
the code is called a "com&shy;mit", which does not only store file con&shy;tents, but also plenty of meta&shy;data. This
cre&shy;ates a very rich set of data, and in the age of open source there are thou&shy;sands of pro&shy;jects to study.
A few ex&shy;am&shy;ples are <a href='https://erikbern.com/2016/12/05/the-half-life-of-code.html' class='external'
target='_blank'>Git of The&shy;seus</a> and <a href='https://gitential.com' class='external'
target='_blank'>Gi&shy;ten&shy;tial</a>, but by fo&shy;cus&shy;ing on "<span class=sourcecode>git blame</span>" (see who
has com&shy;mit&shy;ted each line on each file) I hope to bring some&shy;thing new to the table. In short I have
an&shy;alyzed how source code gets re&shy;placed by newer code, track&shy;ing the top&shy;ics of who, when and why, and
how old the code was.</p>


            <p>Git's com&shy;mit log is a di&shy;rected acyclic graph (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph'
class='external' target='_blank'>DAG</a>), which can be vi&shy;su&shy;al&shy;ized by <a
href='https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk' class='external' target='_blank'>gitk</a> (an ex&shy;am&shy;ple is shown at
Fig&shy;ure 1). A com&shy;mit can have ar&shy;bi&shy;trary many par&shy;ents and chil&shy;dren, but the most
typ&shy;ical cases are just one or two. Com&shy;mits from which a new branch has been cre&shy;ated have more than one
child, and "merge" com&shy;mits have more than one par&shy;ent. As in real life par&shy;ents are "older" than
chil&shy;dren, and the list of a com&shy;mit's par&shy;ents is im&shy;mutable but new chil&shy;dren might
(un&shy;ex&shy;pect&shy;edly or not) ap&shy;pear.</p>

            <p>Git doesn't ac&shy;tu&shy;ally store com&shy;mits as "deltas" from the pre&shy;vi&shy;ous ver&shy;sion, but in&shy;stead
refers to com&shy;plete fold&shy;ers and files (for de&shy;tails have a look at <a
href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals' class='external' target='_blank'>Git in&shy;ter&shy;nals</a>). This
struc&shy;ture has some in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing prop&shy;er&shy;ties, for ex&shy;am&shy;ple when
cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing the dif&shy;fer&shy;ence be&shy;tween two com&shy;mits once can skip en&shy;tire
sub-di&shy;rec&shy;to&shy;ries by just de&shy;ter&shy;min&shy;ing that tree-ob&shy;jects' hashes are
iden&shy;ti&shy;cal. When two files dif&shy;fer, the end user typ&shy;ically wants to ig&shy;nore the
iden&shy;ti&shy;cal parts and just fo&shy;cus on what was changed (a "patch"). Cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing this
rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion is ac&shy;tu&shy;ally a sur&shy;pris&shy;ingly com&shy;plex task, some

            <p>In this pro&shy;ject I used JGit to ex&shy;tract in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion from a repos&shy;itory (aka. "repo"), but as
I was us&shy;ing Clo&shy;jure I was happy to find a JGit wrap&shy;per <a href='https://github.com/clj-jgit/clj-jgit'
class='external' target='_blank'>clj-jgit</a> for it. At the time of writ&shy;ing my source code is only about 200 lines
of code long, but it had to deal with some com&shy;plex&shy;ities such as how to cache in&shy;ter&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate
re&shy;sults to speed up de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment and re-runs, in&shy;den&shy;ti&shy;fy&shy;ing nu&shy;ances such as
JGit throw&shy;ing a null pointer ex&shy;cep&shy;tion when blam&shy;ing a sym&shy;link, how to rep&shy;re&shy;sent files
"blames" and how to ap&shy;ply patches to them, and how to store all the re&shy;sults to Elas&shy;tic&shy;search for
fu&shy;ture anal&shy;ysis.</p>


            <p>The first step on a repos&shy;itory's anal&shy;ysis is to load it from disk to mem&shy;ory via the <span
class=sourcecode>jgit/load-repo</span>, which sets the con&shy;text for all fu&shy;ture API calls such as <span
class=sourcecode>jgit/git-blame</span>. The sec&shy;ond step is to find all com&shy;mits since a given date (as we might
want to fo&shy;cus on last X years of the pro&shy;ject), and find all "root" com&shy;mits. These are com&shy;mits which
have no par&shy;ents, or all of their par&shy;ents were cre&shy;ated be&shy;fore the cho&shy;sen cut&shy;off date. From
these root com&shy;mits we can find all com&shy;mits which fol&shy;low, and par&shy;ti&shy;tion them into a lin&shy;ear
se&shy;quences (each com&shy;mit has ex&shy;actly one par&shy;ent) what I de&shy;cided to call "hash-chains". I
de&shy;cided to ig&shy;nore merge com&shy;mits on this anal&shy;ysis, al&shy;though they are crit&shy;ical points in
branches lives. Merges do not cre&shy;ate new code per se, un&shy;less there is a <a
href='https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/merge-conflicts' class='external'
target='_blank'>merge con&shy;flict</a>.</p>


            <p>At this stage we are closer to run&shy;ning the ac&shy;tual anal&shy;ysis. Cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing <span
class=sourcecode>git blame</span> on a large repo turns out to be a quite ex&shy;pen&shy;sive op&shy;er&shy;ation,
be&shy;cause it needs to de&shy;ter&shy;mine for all lines in all files that from which com&shy;mit it orig&shy;inates.
Luck&shy;ily it is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to cal&shy;cu&shy;late it only for root com&shy;mits (in&shy;stead of all of
them) and only for files which have changes within the com&shy;mits we are in&shy;ter&shy;ested of. In
ad&shy;di&shy;tion it is triv&shy;ial to par&shy;al&shy;lelize. Cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing patches be&shy;tween two
com&shy;mits is or&shy;ders of mag&shy;ni&shy;tude faster, so this anal&shy;ysis can be run rea&shy;son&shy;ably fast by
us&shy;ing "root blames" as a start&shy;ing point and us&shy;ing in&shy;cre&shy;men&shy;tal patches to
de&shy;ter&shy;mine how the "blame state" looks like at sub&shy;se&shy;quent com&shy;mits. Putting all this
to&shy;gether (and some post-pro&shy;cess&shy;ing) re&shy;sults in a se&shy;quence of hash-maps with a very rich set of
in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, an ex&shy;am&shy;ple is shown at Fig&shy;ure 3. It has the chunk's old and new com&shy;mits'
meta&shy;data (date, folder, file name + type, au&shy;thor's name and email and com&shy;mit's hash + mes&shy;sage) and
de&shy;rived in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion in&shy;clud&shy;ing the age of the code and if the new au&shy;thor is the same
as the old one. The "id" of the data item is gen&shy;er&shy;ated in a de&shy;ter&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tic man&shy;ner from
com&shy;mit hashes and the file path so that re-in&shy;dex&shy;ing all data to Elas&shy;tic&shy;search will not leave
old data be&shy;hind, but will in&shy;stead over&shy;write it.</p>

            <p>Nat&shy;urally one can sim&shy;ply keep all data in-mem&shy;ory and run any anal&shy;ysis on it, but
Elas&shy;tic&shy;search + Kibana has been proven to be a very scal&shy;able and rel&shy;atively easy-to-use
so&shy;lu&shy;tion for dash&shy;boards and ad-hoc anal&shy;ysis and search. Thus I de&shy;cided to use it on this
pro&shy;ject as well. I can think of dozens of anal&shy;yses to test on this, but at this time I'll just de&shy;scribe a
very sim&shy;ple one. We all might com&shy;mit buggy code and push it ev&shy;ery now and then, and when this
hap&shy;pens we rush to fix the mis&shy;take. Also typ&shy;ically when a group of soft&shy;ware
de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ers are build&shy;ing a pro&shy;ject, pro&shy;gram&shy;mers tend to work on sep&shy;arate parts of
the code base. By us&shy;ing se&shy;man&shy;tic anal&shy;ysis on the com&shy;mit mes&shy;sage it should be
pos&shy;si&shy;ble to dis&shy;tin&shy;guish these two cases, but I haven't tried it here.</p>


            <p>In&shy;stead I just used Kibana's <a href='https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.2/area-chart.html' class='external'
target='_blank'>area charts</a> to study the cor&shy;re&shy;la&shy;tion be&shy;tween "re-au&shy;thor&shy;ship" (when the
au&shy;thor of the new code is the same per&shy;son who wrote the older ver&shy;sion) and the age of the code. As the
age of the code can vary from min&shy;utes to years, I de&shy;cided to run the vi&shy;su&shy;al&shy;iza&shy;tions in a
log<sub>2</sub> scale (for example 0 corresponds to 2<sup>0</sup> = 1 days and 10 is 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 days or about
2.8 years). A sample area chart is shown in Figure 4. Any analysis based on plain raw histograms is a bit difficult
because different repos have wildly different numbers of commits, so in Figures 5 and 6 the y-axis shows the actual
percentage of re-authorship. There is a clear pattern that when a piece of code gets replaced, the younger it is the
more likely it is that the new author is the same as the old one. I wonder what kinds of more sophisticated analysis is
possible, for example doing more analysis on commit messages or trying to forecast buggy areas of the code base.</p>
