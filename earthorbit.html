            <p>I wanted to find or cre&shy;ate a for&shy;mula which would ac&shy;cept an epoch times&shy;tamp, lat&shy;itude and
lon&shy;gi&shy;tude and it would pro&shy;duce the Sun's ob&shy;served az&shy;imuth and al&shy;ti&shy;tude in
ra&shy;di&shy;ans. It needs to take into ac&shy;count de&shy;tails earth's ax&shy;ial tilt and its po&shy;si&shy;tion on
its or&shy;bit around the sun. To my sur&shy;prise I wasn't able to find such for&shy;mula, so I had to de&shy;velop it
from scratch. Luck&shy;ily earth's or&shy;bit (and or&shy;bits in gen&shy;eral) is a well stud&shy;ied and
doc&shy;umented prob&shy;lem, so I could take some short&shy;cuts.</p>

target='_blank'>Ke&shy;pler's equa&shy;tion</a> does not have an an&shy;alyt&shy;ical so&shy;lu&shy;tion, but it is easy
ap&shy;ply in the "op&shy;po&shy;site" di&shy;rec&shy;tion. Here an ap&shy;prox&shy;imate so&shy;lu&shy;tion is
cre&shy;ated. First an even sam&shy;pling of true anoma&shy;lies is gen&shy;er&shy;ated, cov&shy;er&shy;ing the whole
360&deg; or&shy;bit ro&shy;ta&shy;tion:
<ul style='padding-left: 60px; list-style: disc outside none'>
	&theta; = 0 ... 2 &pi;
<span style='float: right; margin-right: 10px'>(1)</span></ul>

            <p>Next cor&shy;re&shy;spond&shy;ing ec&shy;cen&shy;tric anomaly E is cal&shy;cu&shy;lated from &theta; and the
or&shy;bit's ec&shy;cen&shy;tric&shy;ity e:
<ul style='padding-left: 60px; list-style: disc outside none'>
	E = atan2(&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">1 - e&nbsp;</span> &middot; sin(&theta; / 2), &radic;<span
style="text-decoration:overline;">1 + e&nbsp;</span> &middot; cos(&theta; / 2))
<span style='float: right; margin-right: 10px'>(2)</span></ul></p>


            <p>Mean anomaly M is cal&shy;cu&shy;lated from E by us&shy;ing Ke&shy;pler's equa&shy;tion:
<ul style='padding-left: 60px; list-style: disc outside none'>
	M = E - e sin E
<span style='float: right; margin-right: 10px'>(3)</span></ul></p>


            <p>The M is triv&shy;ial to cal&shy;cu&shy;late for any de&shy;sired cal&shy;en&shy;dar date, so we want to have an
ap&shy;prox&shy;ima&shy;tion for&shy;mula &theta; = f<sub>e</sub>(M) so that pre&shy;vi&shy;ous equa&shy;tion hold
rea&shy;son&shy;ably well. I no&shy;ticed ex&shy;per&shy;imen&shy;tally that it would be a good ap&shy;proach to
ap&shy;prox&shy;imate
<ul style='padding-left: 60px; list-style: disc outside none'>
	f'<sub>e</sub>(M) = (M - &theta;) / e
<span style='float: right; margin-right: 10px'>(4)</span></ul>
for e > 0, and has a some&shy;what con&shy;stant shape for small val&shy;ues of e. Then the fol&shy;low&shy;ing holds:
<ul style='padding-left: 60px; list-style: disc outside none'>
	&theta; = f<sub>e</sub>(M) = M - e &middot; f'<sub>e</sub>(M)
<span style='float: right; margin-right: 10px'>(5)</span></ul></p>


            <p>The ef&shy;fect of e on f'<sub>e</sub>(M) shape can be seen in Fig&shy;ure 2. Most im&shy;por&shy;tantly its
mag&shy;ni&shy;tude is around &plusmn;2, and has val&shy;ues of ex&shy;actly zero at M = 0, M = &pi; and M = 2&pi;. Due
to these prop&shy;er&shy;ties, it is ap&shy;prox&shy;imated by the poly&shy;no&shy;mial 
<ul style='padding-left: 60px; list-style: disc outside none'>
	f'<sub>e</sub>(M) &asymp; a(e) &middot; (M - pi) &middot; (M &middot; (2&pi; - M))<sup>-b(e)</sup>
<span style='float: right; margin-right: 10px'>(6)</span></ul></p>


            <p>The shape of f'<sub>e</sub>(M) for var&shy;ious val&shy;ues of e can be seen in Fig&shy;ure 2. It is no&shy;table that
for M &asymp; &pi; / 2 it has a value of about -2, which in&shy;di&shy;cates that &theta; > M around that re&shy;gion.
This oc&shy;curs be&shy;cause when M &asymp; 0 the planet is clos&shy;est to the Sun, which means it has a higher
an&shy;gu&shy;lar ve&shy;loc&shy;ity. Thus &theta; grows ini&shy;tially faster than the mean anomaly M.</p>

            <p>The ec&shy;cen&shy;tric&shy;ity e's role on a(e) and b(e) is solved by find&shy;ing op&shy;ti&shy;mal a and b for
var&shy;ious dif&shy;fer&shy;ent val&shy;ues of e and fit&shy;ting a model to those find&shy;ings. Pa&shy;ram&shy;eters
are es&shy;ti&shy;mated by min&shy;imiz&shy;ing the stan&shy;dard sum of squared er&shy;rors, which is achieved by
Mat&shy;lab's <a href='http://www.mathworks.se/help/optim/ug/lsqnonlin.html' class='external'
target='_blank'>lsqnonin</a> func&shy;tion. These re&shy;sults are shown in Fig&shy;ure 3. Luck&shy;ily both
pa&shy;ram&shy;eters seem to fol&shy;low the same for&shy;mula y(e) = y<sub>0</sub> + exp(k<sub>1</sub>&middot; log(e) +
k<sub>2</sub>), and k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> can be reliably estimated by fitting a linear trend to the log-log
data points. The constant y<sub>0</sub> (which corresponds to a<sub>0</sub> and b<sub>0</sub>, one for both parameters)
is estimated so that the best log-linear model can be obtained. If that value is off then the log-log plot is no longer
linear, and a more complex model is needed.</p>

            <p>Model ac&shy;cu&shy;racy is de&shy;ter&shy;mined by cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing the max&shy;imum er&shy;ror from the true

on earth's or&shy;bit e &asymp; 0.0167. Two dif&shy;fer&shy;ent mod&shy;els are com&shy;pared in fig&shy;ures 5 and 6: a
sim&shy;pler model which only uses con&shy;stants a<sub>0</sub> and b<sub>0</sub> regardless of the value of e, and the
more accurate model with e-dependent corrections.</p>


            <p>The biggest ben&shy;efit of these cor&shy;rec&shy;tions oc&shy;cur when 0.05 < e < 0.3. When e &asymp; 0 these
corrections are small anyway, and on bigger values of e the model loses its accuracy even with these corrections. The
ratio of simple model's maximum error and better model's error is show in Figure 4. When e = 0.1 the maximum ratio of 4
is reached, which means that the simpler model has 300% higher maximum error than the e-corrected version.</p>

            <p>The next step would be to es&shy;ti&shy;mate the lo&shy;cal co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nate sys&shy;tem from lat&shy;itude,
lon&shy;gi&shy;tude and time, and to use po&shy;lar co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nates to cal&shy;cu&shy;late the per&shy;son's
ori&shy;en&shy;ta&shy;tion with re&shy;spect to the he&shy;lio&shy;cen&shy;tric co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nate sys&shy;tem
where pe&shy;ri&shy;ap&shy;sis (around 3.1. each year) is the "zero" di&shy;rec&shy;tion. Then the Sun's
ap&shy;par&shy;ent al&shy;ti&shy;tude and az&shy;imuth can be eas&shy;ily cal&shy;cu&shy;lated.</p>
