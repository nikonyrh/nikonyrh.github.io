            <p>Tra&shy;di&shy;tional databases such as MySQL are not de&shy;signed to per&shy;form well in an&shy;alyt&shy;ical
queries, which re&shy;quires ac&shy;cess to pos&shy;si&shy;bly all of the rows on se&shy;lected columns. This
re&shy;sults in a full table scan and it can&shy;not ben&shy;efit from any in&shy;dexes. Column-ori&shy;ented
en&shy;gi&shy;nes try to cir&shy;cum&shy;vent this is&shy;sue, but I went one step deeper and made the stor&shy;age
column value ori&shy;ented, sim&shy;ilar to an in&shy;verted in&shy;dex. This re&shy;sults in 2 &#8212; 10&times;
speedup from op&shy;ti&shy;mized colum&shy;nar so&shy;lu&shy;tions and 80&times; the speed of MySQL.</p>


            <p>Fi&shy;nal bench&shy;mark re&shy;sults are pre&shy;sented in Fig&shy;ure 1, but their de&shy;tails are dis&shy;cussed
later. It pre&shy;sents ag&shy;gre&shy;gated query times for nine dif&shy;fer&shy;ent queries of Olap&shy;Calc (this
pro&shy;ject) and five other database prod&shy;ucts. Olap&shy;Calc sup&shy;ports both sin&shy;gle-threaded and
multi-threaded ex&shy;ecu&shy;tion, and in the tested hard&shy;ware multi-thread&shy;ing  gave 3&times; speed boost.
Some database prod&shy;ucts sup&shy;port only a sin&shy;gle ex&shy;ecu&shy;tion thread (MySQL) where as oth&shy;ers
would sup&shy;port multi-thread&shy;ing but it is dis&shy;abled in the free com&shy;mu&shy;nity edi&shy;tion (e.g.
In&shy;fo&shy;Bright). Mon&shy;etDB is multi-threaded and is de&shy;signed to uti&shy;lize CPU cache-aware
al&shy;go&shy;rithms. Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less Olap&shy;Calc is 2.1&times; as fast (100 ms vs. 210 ms). Fur&shy;ther
anal&shy;ysis and mem&shy;ory us&shy;age fol&shy;lows later.</p>

            <p>The read-only database is im&shy;ple&shy;mented as a back&shy;ground FastCGI pro&shy;cess which loads the data from disk
at star&shy;tup. The cur&shy;rent en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment is a 64-bit Linux in&shy;side a vir&shy;tual ma&shy;chine,
in which the data read&shy;ing and on-the-fly in&shy;dex&shy;ing speed is &asymp;14 Mb/s, or 1 Gb in just over a
min&shy;ute. The re&shy;sult&shy;ing mem&shy;ory us&shy;age is 25 &#8212; 35% of the raw file size, de&shy;pend&shy;ing
on the num&shy;ber of unique val&shy;ues in columns. The in&shy;verted in&shy;dex can be fur&shy;ther re&shy;duced by
&asymp;40% by stor&shy;ing it in a com&shy;pressed for&shy;mat. How&shy;ever the on-the-fly de&shy;com&shy;pres&shy;sion
of re&shy;quired columns in&shy;creases the query time to 3.8&times; of the orig&shy;inal time.</p>


            <p>The sys&shy;tem pro&shy;vides a sim&shy;ple HTTP API which re&shy;turns cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tion re&shy;sults as a
JSON string, so it is easy to in&shy;te&shy;grate with any front-end UI or graphs. At the cur&shy;rent stage there is no
any sup&shy;port for SQL queries, but it isn't too dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to add the sup&shy;port. The cur&shy;rent
im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion sup&shy;ports queries which group by a list of columns and asks for a sin&shy;gle
ag&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion func&shy;tion (sum, avg, me&shy;dian, ...) of a sin&shy;gle column.</p>


            <p>The data is stored purely in RAM, so there is no need for disk ac&shy;cess un&shy;less data has been swapped to disk. On
big datasets (50 Gb and be&shy;yond) this will be&shy;come a prob&shy;lem even when com&shy;pres&shy;sion is
uti&shy;lized. This can be avoided by ei&shy;ther pre-ag&shy;gre&shy;gat&shy;ing the data at some level, or by
par&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;ing the data into smaller sub-sets and merg&shy;ing the re&shy;sults from mul&shy;ti&shy;ple
ma&shy;chi&shy;nes. Luck&shy;ily RAM is get&shy;ting cheaper year by year and 64-bit op&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ing
sys&shy;tems have plenty of room for growth in avail&shy;able mem&shy;ory size.</p>


            <p>Cur&shy;rently the only re&shy;quire&shy;ment for in&shy;put files is that their column names fol&shy;low a cer&shy;tain
con&shy;ven&shy;tion. Column names need to be post-fixed with ei&shy;ther _id, _txt or _date to in&shy;di&shy;cate their
type. If a text-type column doesn't have a pre-de&shy;fined id column, the id is auto-gen&shy;er&shy;ated on-the-fly in
the al&shy;pha&shy;bet&shy;ical or&shy;der. The nu&shy;mer&shy;ical val&shy;ues (from which ag&shy;gre&shy;gates are
cal&shy;cu&shy;lated) are iden&shy;ti&shy;fied by the _fact post&shy;fix.</p>


            <p>The un&shy;der&shy;ly&shy;ing stor&shy;age prin&shy;ci&shy;ple is ac&shy;tu&shy;ally very sim&shy;ple: for each column's
each unique value, store the list of row num&shy;bers which have this value. In ef&shy;fect this is an in&shy;verted
in&shy;dex of each column which is typ&shy;ically used by search en&shy;gi&shy;nes. To im&shy;ple&shy;ment a "group by"
func&shy;tion one only needs to im&shy;ple&shy;ment the merg&shy;ing of two lists of in&shy;te&shy;gers, which is a well
stud&shy;ied prob&shy;lem. Stan&shy;dard ap&shy;proaches are <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort-merge_join'
class='external' target='_blank'>Sort-merge join</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join'
class='external' target='_blank'>hash join</a>. In some cases hash join is faster, but it re&shy;quires to ei&shy;ther
store a hash table for all columns (which uses ex&shy;tra mem&shy;ory) or build&shy;ing it on-de&shy;mand (which takes
ex&shy;tra time).</p>


            <p>To uti&shy;lize ef&shy;fi&shy;cient bit-wise AND op&shy;er&shy;ator in joins, a set of row num&shy;bers is stored in a
64-bit in&shy;te&shy;ger by us&shy;ing top 21 bits for the " ad&shy;dress" and 43 bits for the "con&shy;tent". The
ad&shy;dress of n<sup>th</sup> row num&shy;ber is floor(n / 43), and its lo&shy;ca&shy;tion within the block is mod(n,
43). The merge al&shy;go&shy;rithm uti&shy;lizes the stan&shy;dard merge join to find the cor&shy;rect ad&shy;dress and
bit-wise AND to de&shy;ter&shy;mine which rows within the block ex&shy;ist in both columns. This logic is
it&shy;er&shy;atively ap&shy;plied when there are more than two columns. The ad&shy;dress&shy;ing scheme is
il&shy;lus&shy;trated in Fig&shy;ure 2 with a re&shy;duced num&shy;ber of bits vi&shy;su&shy;al&shy;ized. The
stor&shy;age is very com&shy;pact when the con&shy;tent is mostly ones, which oc&shy;curs on
low-car&shy;di&shy;nal&shy;ity columns and if the data is or&shy;dered by this column be&shy;fore in&shy;ser&shy;tion.
If not then most of the bits will be zero and more blocks are re&shy;quired for stor&shy;age. This is coun&shy;tered by
ap&shy;ply&shy;ing an ex&shy;tra com&shy;pres&shy;sion step to those columns which ben&shy;efit the most.</p>

                    <b>Figure 2</b>: Ex&shy;am&shy;ple bi&shy;nary con&shy;tents of four "row num&shy;ber blocks" with 21 bits for ad&shy;dress (on the left) and 64 - 21 = 43 bits for the con&shy;tent (on the right).
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The num&shy;ber of bits used for block ad&shy;dress is a trade&shy;off be&shy;tween ef&shy;fi&shy;ciency, mem&shy;ory
waste on sparse columns and the to&shy;tal num&shy;ber of unique ad&shy;dresses. When n bits are used for ad&shy;dress
and 64 - n for con&shy;tent, the to&shy;tal num&shy;ber of rows that can be sup&shy;ported is f(n) = 2<sup>n</sup>
&mid&shy;dot; (64 - n). For ex&shy;am&shy;ple f(16) &asymp; 3.1 mil&shy;lion,  f(21) &asymp; 90 mil&shy;lion and f(32)
&asymp; 671 mil&shy;lion. The num&shy;ber 21 was cho&shy;sen be&shy;cause 90 mil&shy;lion is not too low limit and 64 =
21 &middot; 3 + 1, which means that three ad&shy;dresses can be stored in a sin&shy;gle 64-bit in&shy;te&shy;ger,
to&shy;gether with a ex&shy;tra bit for stor&shy;ing a flag value. If more than 90 mil&shy;lion rows needs to be
pro&shy;cessed, the data can be par&shy;ti&shy;tioned into mul&shy;ti&shy;ple chunks which are pro&shy;cessed
in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dently and fi&shy;nally merged.</p>


            <p>Dur&shy;ing the merg&shy;ing the next match&shy;ing block ad&shy;dress is found by an ex&shy;po&shy;nen&shy;tial search
strat&shy;egy. It means that the step length is dou&shy;bled un&shy;til the found value is greater than the value which
is be&shy;ing searched. Once this oc&shy;curs it is known that the tar&shy;get value should be found within the
cur&shy;rent in&shy;ter&shy;val, for which a bi&shy;nary search is ex&shy;ecuted. Once the range is nar&shy;rowed down
to a rel&shy;atively short length it is scanned by lin&shy;ear search, be&shy;cause it is more cache friendly and thus
gives some per&shy;for&shy;mance boost.  This al&shy;go&shy;rithm is O(log(d)), where d is the num&shy;ber of
el&shy;ements from the cur&shy;rent lo&shy;ca&shy;tion to the tar&shy;get value. These steps are shown in Fig&shy;ure 3.
Ex&shy;po&shy;nen&shy;tially grow&shy;ing ini&shy;tial steps are shown in red. The searched value is in&shy;di&shy;cated
by the green cir&shy;cle. Af&shy;ter it is by&shy;passed the cur&shy;rent in&shy;ter&shy;val is searched by a

search.</p>

            <p>The merge al&shy;go&shy;rithm pro&shy;duces a list of JSON out&shy;put to&shy;kens, some of which are con&shy;stant
strings such as column names and open&shy;ing tags, and oth&shy;ers are place&shy;hold&shy;ers for ag&shy;gre&shy;gated
val&shy;ues. Ini&shy;tially these place&shy;hold&shy;ers con&shy;tain the list of row num&shy;bers which will be used to
de&shy;ter&shy;mine the ag&shy;gre&shy;gated value, stored in the pre&shy;vi&shy;ously ex&shy;plained block stor&shy;age
for&shy;mat. Then the mea&shy;sure type and ag&shy;gre&shy;gated column is cho&shy;sen, and all place&shy;hold&shy;ers'
val&shy;ues are up&shy;dated to store the re&shy;sult of the ag&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion func&shy;tion. Af&shy;ter this
is done the out&shy;put string can be gen&shy;er&shy;ated. Fur&shy;ther com&shy;plex&shy;ity arises from on-de&shy;mand
de&shy;com&shy;pres&shy;sion and also multi-thread&shy;ing each of these steps.</p>


            <p>The data com&shy;pres&shy;sion is based on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_gamma_coding' class='external'
target='_blank'>Elias gamma cod&shy;ing</a>, which is a vari&shy;able length code and ef&shy;fi&shy;cient in
stor&shy;ing small in&shy;te&shy;gers. Stor&shy;ing the num&shy;ber n takes 2  + 1 bits, which is still
sig&shy;nif&shy;icant for big&shy;ger num&shy;bers. To avoid this prob&shy;lem, two dif&shy;fer&shy;ent strate&shy;gies
are ap&shy;plied (one for block ad&shy;dresses and an&shy;other for block con&shy;tents). For block ad&shy;dresses can
just store the deltas be&shy;tween the ad&shy;dresses, which are a lot bet&shy;ter suited for this type of code. For
block con&shy;tents a run length en&shy;cod&shy;ing is used, and run lengths are stored as Elias gamma codes as well.
Typ&shy;ically this re&shy;duces the mem&shy;ory us&shy;age by 40% but in&shy;creases the pro&shy;cess&shy;ing time to
3&times; of the orig&shy;inal. Per&shy;haps some other com&shy;pres&shy;sion scheme would be faster to
de&shy;com&shy;press.</p>


            <p>In bench&shy;marks the used dataset is 1 Gb of prop&shy;erty list&shy;ings data (&asymp; 6 mil&shy;lion rows), which can
be com&shy;pressed down to 70 Mb by ag&shy;gres&shy;sive set&shy;tings on 7zip. So far I've ran the
bench&shy;mark&shy;ing suite for MySQL, In&shy;fo&shy;Bright, In&shy;finiDB and Mon&shy;etDB. They have quite
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion and de&shy;sign goals, but all the tested queries are like <span
class=sourcecode>&quot;SE&shy;LECT x, y, z, avg(a) FROM table GROUP BY x, y, z OR&shy;DER BY x, y, z&quot;</span>
with&shy;out any <span class=sourcecode>WHERE</span> clauses. The en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment is a 64-bit Linux
run&shy;ning on In&shy;ter Core i7-3630QM @ 2.4 Ghz with 6 of the 8 cores en&shy;abled for the vir&shy;tual
ma&shy;chine, with 4 Gb of RAM. Some care had to be taken to avoid sur&shy;pris&shy;ing caching ef&shy;fects. The
bench&shy;mark is meant to mea&shy;sure the ac&shy;tual cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tion per&shy;for&shy;mance, not caching or
pre-cal&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tion ef&shy;fi&shy;ciency. Ide&shy;ally the sys&shy;tem would re&shy;quire min&shy;imal
con&shy;fig&shy;ura&shy;tion and just adapt to which ever data it is fed.</p>


            <p>The step in the bench&shy;mark is to load the test data to all of these database en&shy;gi&shy;nes. Gen&shy;er&shy;ally
they all sup&shy;port bulk-load&shy;ing of CSV files, but there were some prob&shy;lems with Chi&shy;nese
char&shy;ac&shy;ters in peo&shy;ple's name column. Also there were some dif&shy;fer&shy;ences across ven&shy;dors on
which SQL syn&shy;tax to use, or whether a pro&shy;pri&shy;etary batch load&shy;ing tool was sup&shy;plied. For
Mon&shy;etDB I used <span class=sourcecode>&quot;COPY INTO table FROM STDIN&quot;</span> and In&shy;finiDB has its own
<span class=sourcecode>cpim&shy;port</span> tool. Olap&shy;Calc reads data in di&shy;rectly from a set of CSV files and
oth&shy;ers sup&shy;ported <span class=sourcecode>&quot;LOAD DATA LO&shy;CAL IN&shy;FILE 'file&shy;name' INTO table
FIELDS TER&shy;MI&shy;NATED BY ';'&quot;</span>. Load times and mem&shy;ory us&shy;age re&shy;port is shown in Table 1.</p>

            <p>Run&shy;times of in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;ual queries are shown in Fig&shy;ure 4. The ag&shy;gre&shy;gated val&shy;ues in
the mid&shy;dle column are same as those in ear&shy;lier Fig&shy;ure 1. De&shy;tailed tim&shy;ings on the left gives a
de&shy;tailed view on each pro&shy;duct's per&shy;for&shy;mance, namely Olap&shy;Calc has a very dis&shy;tinct graph
from oth&shy;ers. Olap&shy;Calc's slow&shy;est query took 33&times; as long as the fastest query (16&times; for
com&shy;pressed for&shy;mat), whereas other pro&shy;duct's ra&shy;tios were 1.6 &#8212; 4. Also the query #8 was
rel&shy;atively faster in other sys&shy;tems than in Olap&shy;Calc.</p>

                    <b>Figure 4</b>: Run&shy;times of all 9 queries (on left), their ag&shy;gre&shy;gated val&shy;ues (in mid&shy;dle) and speed com&shy;par&shy;ison to the fastest pro&shy;ject (on right).
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Over&shy;all these run&shy;times were ag&shy;gre&shy;gated into a sin&shy;gle num&shy;ber by cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing
the ge&shy;omet&shy;ric mean. It has a nice prop&shy;erty that 1% in&shy;crease in any of the re&shy;sults has the same
im&shy;pact on the fi&shy;nal score. Av&shy;er&shy;age mean would give a dis&shy;pro&shy;por&shy;tion&shy;ate weight on
queries with longer ex&shy;ecu&shy;tion times. These are plot&shy;ted in the cen&shy;ter of Fig&shy;ure 4. The fastest
pro&shy;ject is multi-threaded Olap&shy;Calc, hav&shy;ing a ge&shy;omet&shy;ric mean of 100 mil&shy;lisec&shy;onds. This
was cho&shy;sen as the base&shy;line to which oth&shy;ers were com&shy;pared. The sec&shy;ond fastest was Mon&shy;etDB
with 2.2&times; run&shy;time, fol&shy;lowed by In&shy;finiDB (10.1&times;), In&shy;fo&shy;Bright (13&times;) and MySQL
(80&times;). Ap&shy;ply&shy;ing com&shy;pres&shy;sion in Olap&shy;Calc causes the run&shy;time to be 5&times; as long.</p>


            <p>Fu&shy;ture ex&shy;ten&shy;sions for Olap&shy;Calc are sup&shy;port for ad-hoc arith&shy;meti&shy;cal queries (like
<span class=sourcecode>&quot;avg(a - b)&quot;</span>), new ag&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion types (at least <span
class=sourcecode>&quot;COUNT(DIS&shy;TINCT abc)&quot;</span>) and SQL pars&shy;ing. A dae&shy;mon based on MySQL core
would al&shy;low stan&shy;dard con&shy;nec&shy;tions be used from other pro&shy;gram&shy;ming lan&shy;guages.
Ad&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;ally cur&shy;rently only "di&shy;men&shy;sion columns" are com&shy;pressed, where the facts (such
as price, area) are stored un&shy;com&shy;pressed in 32-bit floats. Also ad&shy;di&shy;tional com&shy;par&shy;isons
should be done, for ex&shy;am&shy;ple with Post&shy;greSQL, Lu&shy;cidDB and Ver&shy;tica. The us&shy;age of big&shy;ger
datasets could be en&shy;abled by us&shy;ing mem&shy;ory-mapped files.</p>
