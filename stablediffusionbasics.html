Dif&shy;fu&shy;sion</a> is an im&shy;age gen&shy;er&shy;ation net&shy;work, which was re&shy;leased to the pub&shy;lic
in 2022. It is based on a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model' class='external'
target='_blank'>dif&shy;fu&shy;sion pro&shy;cess</a>, in which the model gets a noisy im&shy;age as an in&shy;put and it
tries to gen&shy;er&shy;ate a noise-free im&shy;age as an out&shy;put. This pro&shy;cess can be guided by
de&shy;scrib&shy;ing the tar&shy;get im&shy;age in plain En&shy;glish (aka txt2img), and op&shy;tion&shy;ally even
giv&shy;ing it a tar&shy;get im&shy;age (aka. img2img). This ar&shy;ti&shy;cle doesn't de&shy;scribe how the model works
and how to run it your&shy;self, in&shy;stead this is more of a tu&shy;to&shy;rial on how var&shy;ious
pa&shy;ram&shy;eters af&shy;fect the re&shy;sult&shy;ing im&shy;age. Non-tech&shy;ni&shy;cal peo&shy;ple can use these
im&shy;age gen&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ing AIs via web&shy;pages such as <a href='https://www.artistic.wtf' class='external'
target='_blank'>Ar&shy;tis&shy;tic.wtf</a> (my and my friend's pro&shy;ject), <a href='https://www.craiyon.com'
class='external' target='_blank'>Craiyon.com</a>, <a href='http://midjourney.com' class='external'
target='_blank'>Mid&shy;jour&shy;ney.com</a> and others.

            <p>This ar&shy;ti&shy;cle shows how three dif&shy;fer&shy;ent pa&shy;ram&shy;eters (num&shy;ber of steps, "CFG" or
clas&shy;si&shy;fier-free guid&shy;ance scale, and img2img strength) af&shy;fect the im&shy;age. These may
in&shy;ter&shy;act with each other in com&shy;plex ways, but that isn't stud&shy;ied here. Ex&shy;per&shy;iments use
five dif&shy;fer&shy;ent in&shy;put texts (aka "prompts"): "a white par&shy;rot sit&shy;ting by the sea", "full length
por&shy;trait of gor&shy;geous god&shy;dess stand&shy;ing in field full of flow&shy;ers", "panda movie poster with
yel&shy;low back&shy;ground and red ti&shy;tle text", "moun&shy;tains by a river" and "an an&shy;cient yel&shy;low robot
hold&shy;ing a sword on de&shy;sert". In ad&shy;di&shy;tion they con&shy;tain "prompt-en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing" terms
such as "cin&shy;ematic, highly de&shy;tailed, il&shy;lus&shy;tra&shy;tion, con&shy;cept ar". These greatly im&shy;prove
the re&shy;sults, but that topic isn't cov&shy;ered here ei&shy;ther. One can find prompt ex&shy;am&shy;ples from sites
such as <a href='https://lexica.art/' class='external' target='_blank'>lex&shy;ica.art</a> and <a
href='https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion' class='external'
target='_blank'>hug&shy;ging&shy;face.co's Mag&shy;icPrompt</a>.</p>


            <p>Vari&shy;ations of the "same" im&shy;age are gen&shy;er&shy;ated by chang&shy;ing the seed of a ran&shy;dom num&shy;ber
gen&shy;er&shy;ator. This af&shy;fects the noise from which de&shy;nois&shy;ing steps are started (the
dif&shy;fu&shy;sion pro&shy;cess), and the al&shy;go&shy;rithm will con&shy;verge to quite dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
look&shy;ing im&shy;ages. But they should still be con&shy;sep&shy;tu&shy;ally sim&shy;ilar. Here three
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent seeds are used for each ex&shy;per&shy;iment.</p>


            <p>Each pa&shy;ram&shy;eter is var&shy;ied to eight dif&shy;fer&shy;ent val&shy;ues, ei&shy;ther on a lin&shy;ear or
log&shy;arith&shy;mic scale. Thus each fig&shy;ure con&shy;sists of 3 &times; 8 sub-im&shy;ages. Orig&shy;inally each
im&shy;age was gen&shy;er&shy;ated on a res&shy;olu&shy;tion of 512 &times; 512 (ex&shy;cept the panda poster, since it
has a dif&shy;fer&shy;ent as&shy;pect ra&shy;tio), so the re&shy;sult&shy;ing im&shy;age tile would have a
res&shy;olu&shy;tion of 1536 &times; 4096, and there are 20 such im&shy;ages in to&shy;tal. This brings the to&shy;tal
im&shy;age size to 156 megapix&shy;els, which would make the file size rel&shy;atively large. Orig&shy;inal PNGs take
180 MB, but the used im&shy;ages here have a res&shy;olu&shy;tion of 2560 &times; 960, and with a JPG qual&shy;ity of
90% their to&shy;tal size is only 12 MB (93% less).</p>

Ma&shy;jor de&shy;tails have con&shy;verged by the 4th or 5th column (15 &amp; 18 steps), but there is still a no&shy;tice&shy;able jump on the last two columns (21 &amp; 50 steps). The "sea" back&shy;ground lacks any in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing de&shy;tails.
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The de&shy;fault set&shy;tings are 50 de&shy;nois&shy;ing steps, CFG scale of 7.5 and ref&shy;er&shy;ence im&shy;age
strength of 0 (mean&shy;ing no ref&shy;er&shy;ence im&shy;age). All other pa&shy;ram&shy;eters are kept con&shy;stant
while one other pa&shy;ram&shy;eter is var&shy;ied.  (Note: the com&shy;mmon con&shy;ven&shy;tion on img2img
ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions seems to spec&shy;ify the weight of the added ran&shy;dom noise, not the weight of the
in&shy;put im&shy;age! Here the "im&shy;age strength" is 1 - "noise strength".) The re&shy;sults shown here are based on
Sta&shy;ble Dif&shy;fu&shy;sion model ver&shy;sion <a
href='https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original' class='external' target='_blank'>1.4</a> and using
the "DDIM" sampler.</p>


            <p>The first var&shy;ied pa&shy;ram&shy;eter is the <b>num&shy;ber of de&shy;nois&shy;ing steps</b>. The used val&shy;ues
are [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 50], and usu&shy;ally the im&shy;age has con&shy;verged by step 50. These re&shy;sults are
shown in fig&shy;ures 1 - 5.</p>

The re&shy;sult is quite ac&shy;cept&shy;able al&shy;ready by column four (12 steps), and by 24 steps it has con&shy;verged so much that the re&shy;sult is very sim&shy;ilar as when us&shy;ing 50 steps (the right-most column).

Here the con&shy;ver&shy;gence is quite slow, and the pose keeps chang&shy;ing through&shy;out the pro&shy;cess. De&shy;pend&shy;ing on the seed, steps 24 and 50 may pro&shy;duce very dif&shy;fer&shy;ent look&shy;ing im&shy;ages. This means that us&shy;ing a lower step-count for pre&shy;view&shy;ing seeds doesn't al&shy;ways work.

            <p>All im&shy;ages have their ma&shy;jor as&shy;pects de&shy;fined al&shy;ready with just 10 - 15 de&shy;nois&shy;ing
steps. Most of the time even go&shy;ing from 24 to 50 steps doesn't change the re&shy;sult in any ma&shy;jor way, but of
course there are ex&shy;cep&shy;tions. The most chal&shy;leng&shy;ing in&shy;puts were "full length por&shy;trait of
gor&shy;geous god&shy;dess stand&shy;ing in field full of flow&shy;ers" (Fig&shy;ure 3 and "panda movie poster with
yel&shy;low back&shy;ground and red ti&shy;tle text" (Fig&shy;ure 5). They don't have much in com&shy;mon, but the
"god&shy;dess" has a com&shy;plex fore&shy;ground and back&shy;ground, and the "panda" has ty&shy;pog&shy;ra&shy;phy
(seems to have ei&shy;ther Chi&shy;nese or En&shy;glish de&shy;pend&shy;ing on the seed), high-con&shy;trast&shy;ing
col&shy;ors and just a vague idea on how the com&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion should look like.</p>


            <p>This is in&shy;con&shy;trast to the "a white par&shy;rot sit&shy;ting by the sea" (Fig&shy;ure 1) and "an an&shy;cient
yel&shy;low robot hold&shy;ing a sword on de&shy;sert" (Fig&shy;ure 2), which have a some&shy;what con&shy;strained pose
and a sim&shy;pler back&shy;ground. Al&shy;though the set of all pos&shy;si&shy;ble robots has huge va&shy;ri&shy;ety.</p>

            <b>Step pa&shy;ram&shy;eter sum&shy;mary</b>: This pa&shy;ram&shy;eter is an easy one to tune, since the end re&shy;sult
is al&shy;most al&shy;ways bet&shy;ter with more steps. Some&shy;times the end re&shy;sult has con&shy;verged af&shy;ter
30 steps, but it is bet&shy;ter to let it run for 50 steps to be sure. And it is very rare that the end re&shy;sult

            <p>The next stud&shy;ied pa&shy;ram&shy;eter is the "CFG" or <b>clas&shy;si&shy;fier-free guid&shy;ance scale</b>, or just
"scale". It is de&shy;scribed for ex&shy;am&shy;ple at <a
href='https://diffusion-news.org/stable-diffusion-settings-parameters' class='external'
target='_blank'>dif&shy;fu&shy;sion-news.org</a>, but the con&shy;clu&shy;sions there are con&shy;flict&shy;ing with
ex&shy;per&shy;imen&shy;tal re&shy;sults which are shown in this ar&shy;ti&shy;cle. Ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the
ar&shy;ti&shy;cle, it "is a mea&shy;sure of how close you want the model to stick to your prompt when look&shy;ing for a
re&shy;lated im&shy;age to show you. A Cfg Scale value of 0 will give you es&shy;sen&shy;tially a ran&shy;dom im&shy;age
based on the seed, where as a Cfg Scale of 20 (the max&shy;imum on SD) will give you the clos&shy;est match to your
prompt that the model can pro&shy;duce." They even run the tests with var&shy;ious dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
<b>sam&shy;plers</b>, but those aren't cov&shy;ered in this ar&shy;ti&shy;cle for the sake of stick&shy;ing to
ba&shy;sics.</p>


            <p>Tested CFG scales are from the for&shy;mula 1 + 6.5 * 10<sup>i</sup>, where i is in&shy;ter&shy;po&shy;lated
lin&shy;early be&shy;tween -1 and 1. This was cho&shy;sen so that the de&shy;fault scale of 7.5 is in the mid&shy;dle.
The val&shy;ues (rounded to two dec&shy;imals) are [1.65,  2.25,  3.42,  5.68, 10.03, 18.44, 34.67, 66.0]. But the
ac&shy;tual mid&shy;dle value 7.5 isn't pre&shy;sent in the list, since there is an even num&shy;ber of sam&shy;ples.
Ex&shy;am&shy;ples are shown in fig&shy;ures 6 - 10.</p>

            <p>The scale pa&shy;ram&shy;eter has a very con&shy;crete im&shy;pact on the re&shy;sult&shy;ing artis&shy;tic style.
Smaller num&shy;bers seem to cause the it&shy;er&shy;ation to fo&shy;cus on smaller scale de&shy;tail, and the
over&shy;all con&shy;trast and sat&shy;ura&shy;tion is fairly weak. But if such artis&shy;tic style is de&shy;sired,
con&shy;trast and sat&shy;ura&shy;tion can be eas&shy;ily fixed in post-pro&shy;cess&shy;ing. Pa&shy;ram&shy;eters 6 - 8
give the most re&shy;al&shy;is&shy;tic and well-bal&shy;anced re&shy;sults. Go&shy;ing be&shy;yond that, the
re&shy;sults get pro&shy;gres&shy;sively to the op&shy;po&shy;site di&shy;rec&shy;tion. They have very vi&shy;brant

            <p>The next stud&shy;ied pa&shy;ram&shy;eter is the img2img <b>strength</b> (or "weight"), a value be&shy;tween 0% and
100%. The all pre&shy;vi&shy;ously de&shy;scribed pa&shy;ram&shy;eters still play a role, but here they are kept to
their de&shy;fault val&shy;ues (run&shy;ning for 50 steps and the CFG scale is 7.5). Note that be&shy;cause of
rea&shy;sons, the strength has an op&shy;po&shy;site con&shy;ven&shy;tion that orig&shy;inal work such as source code at
<a href='https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion' class='external'
target='_blank'>github.com/Com&shy;pVis/sta&shy;ble-dif&shy;fu&shy;sion</a> which says "strength is a value be&shy;tween
0.0 and 1.0, that con&shy;trols the amount of noise that is added to the in&shy;put im&shy;age. Val&shy;ues that
ap&shy;proach 1.0 al&shy;low for lots of vari&shy;ations but will also pro&shy;duce im&shy;ages that are not
se&shy;man&shy;ti&shy;cally con&shy;sis&shy;tent with the in&shy;put." Ba&shy;si&shy;cally it is a trade-off
pa&shy;ram&shy;eter be&shy;tween the im&shy;age gen&shy;er&shy;ated purely from the prompt, and the tar&shy;get
im&shy;age. 0% noise means that the out&shy;put re&shy;sem&shy;bles the tar&shy;get 100%, and 100% noise means that the
tar&shy;get im&shy;age has no im&shy;pact. Hope&shy;fully this isn't con&shy;fus&shy;ing any&shy;body.</p>


            <p>The weight is a very del&shy;icate pa&shy;ram&shy;eter to tune, and if the two im&shy;ages (from the prompt and the
tar&shy;get) are very dif&shy;fer&shy;ent, then there might be a tip&shy;ping point where chang&shy;ing the weight even
a lit&shy;tle bit will have a large change in the re&shy;sult&shy;ing im&shy;age. How&shy;ever this de&shy;pends very
much on the con&shy;text, and on many ex&shy;per&shy;iments the re&shy;sults had a nice gradu&shy;lar change. But
be&shy;cause of this, the img2img ex&shy;eper&shy;iments were run with two dif&shy;fer&shy;ent pa&shy;ram&shy;eter
gra&shy;di&shy;ents. The first one uses weights [0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, 0.21], and the sec&shy;ond one uses
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]. The re&shy;sults are shwon in fig&shy;ures 11 - 20. Note that only seven
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent weights were used, but im&shy;ages con&shy;sist of eight columns. This is be&shy;cause the
right-most pic&shy;ture al&shy;ways shows the tar&shy;get im&shy;age (cor&shy;re&shy;spond&shy;ing to a strength of 1.0,
or noise-level of zero).</p>

            <p>Fi&shy;ugres 13, 14 ("robot"), 17 and 18 ("moun&shy;tains") show that one must use very low strengths if the tar&shy;get
im&shy;age is un&shy;re&shy;al&shy;is&shy;tic, hav&shy;ing lots re&shy;gions with uni&shy;form color and lacks
small-scale de&shy;tails. Bet&shy;ter re&shy;sults could be ob&shy;tained by run&shy;ning the img2img
gen&shy;er&shy;ation sev&shy;eral times, us&shy;ing a low strength value each time and pick&shy;ing the most
promis&shy;ing look&shy;ing im&shy;age as a start&shy;ing point for the next it&shy;er&shy;ation.</p>


            <p>Other ex&shy;am&shy;ples show that best re&shy;sults are ob&shy;tained by us&shy;ing a re&shy;al&shy;is&shy;tic
in&shy;put im&shy;age to be&shy;gin with, if re&shy;al&shy;is&shy;tic re&shy;sults are de&shy;sired. But since it is
very con&shy;text-de&shy;pen&shy;dent on which strength val&shy;ues pro&shy;duce res&shy;on&shy;able re&shy;sults,
trial-and-er&shy;ror ap&shy;proach seems the eas&shy;iest one. And one must not for&shy;get that CFG scale can be
changed as well from the de&shy;fault 7.5, and it will have a ma&shy;jor im&shy;pact on the out&shy;come as well.</p>

            <b>Img2img strength pa&shy;ram&shy;eter sum&shy;mary</b>: The re&shy;sults de&shy;pend very much on the prompt and the
tar&shy;get im&shy;age. Some cases work best with a very small weight, while oth&shy;ers re&shy;quire a larger one so
trial-and-er&shy;ror must be used. But in gen&shy;eral smaller weights work best when the tar&shy;get im&shy;age is
un&shy;re&shy;al&shy;is&shy;tic and lacks de&shy;tail, and larger weights can be used when the tar&shy;get im&shy;age is
aready re&shy;al&shy;is&shy;tic.

            <p>There are still many more top&shy;ics to study, such as what kind of de&shy;scrip&shy;tions to ap&shy;pend to the
prompt, us&shy;ing dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ver&shy;sions of the model (ver&shy;sion 1.5 is al&shy;reayd out), us&shy;ing
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent sam&shy;plers among oth&shy;ers.</p>
